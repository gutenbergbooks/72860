<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
CAMPBELL'S ISLE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The island lies nine leagues away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along its solitary shore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of craggy rock and sandy bay<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sound but ocean's roar,<br>
  Save where the bold, wild sea-bird makes her home,<br>
  Her shrill cry coming through the sparkling foam."&mdash;R. H. DANA.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
About six miles from the mainland of M&mdash;&mdash;, with
its rock-bound coast washed by the waters of the
broad Atlantic, was an islet known in the days of
which I write as Campbell's Isle.
</p>

<p>
The island was small&mdash;about two miles in length and
the same in breadth, but fertile and luxurious.  The
dense primeval forest, which as yet the destroying ax had
scarcely touched, reared itself high and dark in the
northern part of the island.  A deep, unbroken silence ever
reigned here, save when some gay party from the opposite
coast visited the island to fish or shoot partridges.
Sometimes during the summer, pleasure parties were held
here, but in the winter all was silent and dreary on the
lonely, isolated little spot.
</p>

<p>
This island had been, from time immemorial, in the
possession of a family named Campbell, handed down
from father to son.  The people of the surrounding
country had learned to look upon them as the rightful lords
of the soil, "to the manner born."  The means by which
it had first come into their possession were seldom
thought of, or if thought of, only added to their
reputation as a bold and daring race.  The legend ran, that
long before Calvert came over, a certain Sir Guy Campbell,
a celebrated freebooter and scion of the noble Scottish
clan of that name, who for some reckless crime had
been outlawed and banished, and in revenge had hoisted
the black flag and become a rover on the high seas, had,
in his wanderings, discovered this solitary island, which
he made the place of his rendezvous.  Here, with his
band of dare-devils&mdash;all outlaws like himself&mdash;he held
many a jolly carousal that made the old woods ring.
</p>

<p>
In one of his adventures he had taken captive a young
Spanish girl, whose wondrous beauty at once conquered
a heart all unused to the tender passion.  He bore off his
prize in triumph, and without asking her consent, made
her his wife at the first port he touched.  Soon, however,
tiring of her company on shipboard, he brought her to his
island home, and their left her to occupy his castle, while
he sailed merrily away.  One year afterward, Sir Guy the
Fearless, as he was called, was conquered by an English
sloop-of-war; and, true to his daring character, he blew
up the vessel, and, together with his crew and captors,
perished in the explosion.
</p>

<p>
His son and successor, Gasper, born on the isle, grew
up tall, bold, and handsome, with all his father's daring
and undaunted courage, and his mother's beauty, and torrid
passionate nature.  He, in the course of time, took to
himself a wife of the daughters of the mainland; and, after
a short, stormy life, passed away in his turn to render an
account of his works, leaving to his eldest son, Hugh, the
bold spirit of his forefathers, the possession of Campbell's
Isle, and the family mansion known as Campbell's Lodge.
</p>

<p>
And so, from one generation to another, the Campbells
ruled as lords of the isle, and became, in after years, as
noted for their poverty as their pride.  A reckless,
improvident race they were, caring only for to-day, and letting
to-morrow care for itself; quick and fierce to resent
injury or insult, and implacable as death or doom in their
hate.  Woe to the man who would dare point in scorn at
one of their name!  Like a sleuth-hound they would dog
his steps night and day, and rest not until their vengeance
was sated.
</p>

<p>
Fierce alike in love and hatred, the Campbells of the
Isle were known and dreaded for miles around.  From
sire to son the fiery blood of Sir Guy the Fearless passed
unadulterated, and throbbed in the veins of Mark Campbell,
the late master of the lodge, in a darker, fiercer
stream than in any that had gone before.  A heavy-browed,
stern-hearted man he was, of whose dark deeds wild
rumors went whispering about, for no one dared breathe
them aloud, lest they should reach his vindictive ears, and
rouse the slumbering tiger in his breast.  At his death,
which took place some two or three years previous to the
opening of our story, his son Guy, a true descendant of
his illustrious namesake, became the lord and master of
the isle, and the last of the Campbells.
</p>

<p>
Young Guy showed no disposition to pass his days in
the spot where he was born.  After the death of his father,
Guy resolved to visit foreign lands, and leave Campbell's
Lodge to the care of an old black servant, Aunt Moll, and
her son Lem, both of whom had passed their lives in the
service of the family, and considered that in some sort the
honor of the house lay in their hands.
</p>

<p>
Vague rumors were current that the old house was
haunted.  Fishermen out, casting their nets, avowed that
at midnight, blue, unearthly lights flashed from the upper
chambers&mdash;where it was known Aunt Moll never went&mdash;and
wild, piercing shrieks, that chilled the blood with
horror, echoed on the still night air.  The superstitious
whispered that Black Mark had been sent back by his
master, the Evil One, to atone for his wicked deeds done
in the flesh, and that his restless spirit would ever haunt
the old lodge&mdash;the scene, it was believed, of many an
appalling crime.  Be that as it may, the old house was
deserted, save by Aunt Moll and her hopeful son; and
young Guy, taking with him his only sister, spent his time
in cruising about in a schooner he owned, and&mdash;it was
said, among the rest of the rumors&mdash;in <i>cheating the revenue</i>.
</p>

<p>
Besides the lodge, or Campbell's Castle, as it was
sometimes called, the island contained but one other
habitation, occupied by a widow, a distant connection of the
Campbells, who, after the death of her husband, had come
here to reside.  The cottage was situated on the summit
of a gentle elevation that commanded an extensive view
of the island; for Mrs. Tomlinson&mdash;or Mrs. Tom, as she
was always called&mdash;liked a wide prospect.
</p>

<p>
The most frugal, the most industrious of housewives
was Mrs. Tom.  No crime in her eyes equaled that of
thriftlessness, and all sins could be pardoned but that of
laziness.  Unfortunately for her peace of mind, she was
afflicted with an orphan nephew, the laziest of mortals,
whose shortcomings kept the bustling old lady in a fever
from morning till night.  A wild young sister of Mrs. Tom's
had run away with a Dutch fiddler, and dying a few
years after, was soon followed to the grave by her
husband, who drank more than was good for him one night,
and was found dead in the morning.  Master Carl Henley
was accordingly adopted by his living relative and, as that
good lady declared, had been "the death of her" ever since.
</p>

<p>
A young girl of sixteen, known only as "Christie,"
was the only other member of Mrs. Tom's family.  Who
this girl was, where she had come from, and what was her
family name, was a mystery: and Mrs. Tom, when questioned
on the subject, only shut her lips and shook her
head mysteriously, and spoke never a word.  Although
she called the old lady aunt, it was generally believed that
she was no relation; but as Christie was a favorite with
all who visited the island, the mystery concerning her,
though it piqued the curiosity of the curious, made them
like her none the less.  A big Newfoundland dog and a
disagreeable chattering parrot completed the widow's
household.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom's business was flourishing.  She made a regular
visit each week to the mainland, where she disposed
of fish, nuts, and berries, in which the island abounded,
and brought back groceries and such things as she needed.
Besides that, she kept a sort of tavern and place of
refreshment for the sailors and fishermen, who sometimes stopped
for a day or two on the island; and for many a mile, both
by land and sea, was known the fame of Mrs. Tom.
</p>

<p>
Such was Campbell's Isle, and such were its owners
and occupants.  For many years now it had been quiet
and stagnant enough, until the development of sundry
startling events that for long afterward were remembered
in the country around and electrified for a time the whole
community.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
THE MAGIC MIRROR.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "I turned my eyes, and as I turned surveyed<br>
  An awful vision."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The sun was sinking in the far west as the little
schooner Evening Star went dancing over the
bright waves towards Campbell's Isle.  Captain
Guy Campbell stood leaning negligently over the taffrail,
solacing himself with a cigar, and conversing at intervals
with a slight, somewhat haughty-looking young man, who
stood beside him, watching the waves flashing, as they
sped along.  No two could be more opposite, as far as
looks went, than those two, yet both were handsome and
about the same age.
</p>

<p>
Like all his race, young Campbell was very tall, and
dark as a Spaniard.  His short, black, curling hair
shadowed a forehead high, bold, and commanding.  Dark,
keen, proud eyes flashed from beneath jetty eye-brows,
and the firm, resolute mouth gave to his dark face a look
almost fierce.  His figure was exquisitely proportioned
and there was a certain bold frankness, mingled with a
reckless, devil-may-care expression in his fine face, that
atoned for his swarthy complexion and stern brows.
</p>

<p>
His companion was a tall, elegant young man, with an
air of proud superiority about him, as though he were
"somebody," and knew it.  His complexion was fair as a
lady's, and would have been effeminate but for the dark,
bold eyes and his dashing air generally.  There was
something particularly winning in his handsome face,
especially when he smiled, that lit up his whole countenance
with new beauty.  Yet, with all, there was a certain
faithless expression about the finely formed mouth that would
have led a close observer to hesitate before trusting him
too far.  This, reader, was Mr. Willard Drummond, a
young half-American, half-Parisian, and heir to one of
the finest estates in the Old Dominion.  The last five
years he had passed in Paris, and when he was thinking
of returning home he had encountered Campbell and his
sister.  Fond of luxury and ease as the young patrician
was, he gave up all, after that, for the attraction he
discovered on board the schooner Evening Star.  And
Captain Campbell, pleased with his new friend, invited him
to cross the ocean with him, and spend a few weeks with
him in his ancestral home, whither he was obliged to stop
while some repairs were being made in his vessel, which
invitation Willard Drummond, nothing loth, accepted.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Campbell, how is that patient of yours this
evening?" inquired Drummond, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Don't know," replied Captain Campbell, carelessly;
"I haven't seen him since morning.  Sibyl is with him
now."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, where did you pick him up?  He was
not one of your crew, I understand."
</p>

<p>
"No; I met him in Liverpool.  He came to me one day,
and asked me to take him home.  I replied that I had no
accommodations, and would much rather not be troubled
with passengers.  However, he pleaded so hard for me to
accommodate him, and looked so like something from the
other world all the time, that I had not the heart to refuse
the poor fellow.  Before we had been three days out at sea
he was taken ill, and has been raving and shrieking ever
since, as you know."
</p>

<p>
"What do you suppose is the matter with him?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I haven't much experience as nurse myself, but
I think it's brain fever, or something of that kind; Sibyl,
however, thinks that bitter remorse for something he has
done is preying on his mind, and girls always know best
in these cases."
</p>

<p>
"He is, if I may judge by his looks, of humble station,"
said Mr. Drummond, in an indifferent tone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; there can be no doubt of <i>that</i>, though he appears
to have plenty of money."
</p>

<p>
"Has he given his name?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Richard Grove."
</p>

<p>
"Hum!  Well, it would be unpleasant to have him die
on board, of course," said Drummond.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I think he'll live to reach our destination; he does
not appear to be sinking very fast."
</p>

<p>
"We must now be quite near this island home of yours,
Captain Campbell; I grow impatient to see it."
</p>

<p>
"We shall reach it about moonrise to-night, if the wind
holds as it is now."
</p>

<p>
"And what, may I ask, do you intend doing with
this&mdash;Richard Grove, when you get there?  Will you take
him into your Robinson Crusoe castle and nurse him
until he gets well, as that enterprising canoe-builder did
Friday's father?
</p>

<p>
"No, I think not.  There is an old lady on the island,
who is never so happy as when she has some one to nurse.
I think we'll consign him to her."
</p>

<p>
"Then there is another habitation on the island beside
yours?" said Drummond, looking up with more interest
than he had yet manifested.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; old Mrs. Tom, a distant connection of our family,
I believe.  And, by the way, Drummond, there is a
pretty little girl in the case.  I suppose that will interest
you more than the old woman."
</p>

<p>
"Pretty girls are an old story by this time," said
Drummond, with a yawn.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, with such a renowned lady-killer as you, no
doubt."
</p>

<p>
"I never saw but one girl in the world worth the
trouble of loving," said Drummond, looking thoughtfully
into the water.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, what a paragon she must have been.  May I ask
what quarter of the globe has the honor of containing so
peerless a beauty?"
</p>

<p>
"I never said she was a beauty, <i>mon ami</i>.  But never
mind that.  When do you expect to be ready for sea
again?"
</p>

<p>
"As soon as possible&mdash;in a few weeks, perhaps&mdash;for I
fear that we'll all soon get tired of the loneliness of the
place."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to be pretty well accustomed to its
loneliness by this time."
</p>

<p>
"Not I, faith!  It's now three years since I have been
there."
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible?  I thought you Campbells were too
much attached to your ancestral home to desert it so long
as that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's a dreary place, and I have such an attachment
for a wild, exciting life that positively I could not
endure it.  I should die of stagnation.  As for Sibyl, my
wild, impulsive sister, she would now as soon think of
entering a convent as passing her life there."
</p>

<p>
"Yet you said it was partly by her request you were
going there now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she expressed a wish to show you the place."  A
slight flush of pleasure colored the clear face of
Drummond.  "I don't know what's got into Sibyl lately,"
continued her brother.  "I never saw a girl so changed.
She used to be the craziest leap-over-the-moon madcap
that ever existed; now she is growing as tame as&mdash;as little
Christie."
</p>

<p>
Drummond's fine eyes were fixed keenly on the frank,
open face of Captain Campbell; but nothing was to be read
there more than his words contained.  With a peculiar
smile he turned away, and said, carelessly:
</p>

<p>
"And who is this little Christie to whom you refer?"
</p>

<p>
"She's the <i>protege</i> of the old lady on the island&mdash;fair as
the dream of an opium-eater, enchanting as a houri, and
with the voice of an angel."
</p>

<p>
"Whew! the bold Campbell, the daring descendant of
old Guy the Fearless, has lost his heart at last!" laughed
Willard Drummond.
</p>

<p>
"Not I," answered Guy, carelessly.  "I never yet saw
the woman who could touch my heart, and, please Heaven,
never will."
</p>

<p>
"Well, here's a wonder&mdash;a young man of three-and-twenty,
and never in love!  Do you expect me to believe
such a fable, my good friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Believe or not, as you will, it is nevertheless true."
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;do you mean to say you have never felt a
touch of the <i>grande passion</i>&mdash;the slightest symptom of that
infectious disorder?"
</p>

<p>
"Pooh! boyish fancies go for nothing.  I have now
and then felt a queer sensation about the region of my
heart at the sight of sundry faces at different times, but as
for being fatally and incorrigibly in love, never, on my
honor!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, before you reach the age of thirty, you'll have
a different story to tell, or I'm mistaken."
</p>

<p>
"No; there is no danger, I fancy, unless indeed," he
added, fixing his eyes quizzically on Drummond's handsome
face, "I should happen to meet this little enchantress
you spoke of awhile ago."
</p>

<p>
A cloud passed over the brow of his companion; but
it cleared away in a moment as a quick, light footstep was
heard approaching, and the next instant Sibyl Campbell,
the haughty daughter of a haughty race, stood bright,
dazzling, and smiling before them.
</p>

<p>
No one ever looked once in the face of Sibyl Campbell
without turning to gaze again.  Peerlessly beautiful
as she was, it was not her beauty that would startle you,
but the look of wild power, of intense daring, of fierce
passions, of unyielding energy, of a will powerful for love
or hate, of a nature loving, passionate, fiery, impulsive,
and daring, yet gentle and winning.
</p>

<p>
She might have been seventeen years of age&mdash;certainly
not more.  In stature she was tall, and with a
form regally beautiful, splendidly developed, with a
haughty grace peculiarly her own.  Her face was
perfectly oval: her complexion, naturally olive, had been
tanned by sun and wind to a rich, clear, gipsyish
darkness.  Her hair, that hung in a profusion of long curls,
was of jetty blackness, save where the sun fell on it,
bringing out red rings of fire.  Her large Syrian eyes, full of
passion and power, were of the most intense blackness,
now flashing with sparks of light, and anon swimming in
liquid tenderness.  Her high, bold brow might have
become a crown&mdash;certainly it was regal in its pride and
scorn.  Her mouth, which was the only voluptuous feature
in her face, was small, with full, ripe, red lips,
rivaling in bloom the deep crimson of her dark cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Her dress was like herself&mdash;odd and picturesque,
consisting of a short skirt of black silk, a bodice of crimson
velvet, with gilt buttons.  She held in one hand a black
velvet hat, with a long, sweeping plume, swinging it
gayly by the strings as she came toward them.
</p>

<p>
She was a strange, wild-looking creature, altogether;
yet what would first strike an observer was her queenly
air of pride, her lofty hauteur, her almost unendurable
arrogance.  For her unbending pride, as well as her
surprising beauty, the haughty little lady had obtained, even
in childhood, the title of "Queen of the Isle."  And
queenly she looked, with her noble brow, her flashing,
glorious eyes, her dainty, curving lips, her graceful,
statuesque form&mdash;in every sense of the word "a queen of
noble Nature's crowning."
</p>

<p>
And Willard Drummond, passionate admirer of beauty
as he was, what thought he of this dazzling creature?  He
leaned negligently still against the taffrail, with his eyes
fixed on her sparkling, sunbright face, noting every look
and gesture as one might gaze on some strange, beautiful
creation, half in fear, half in love, but wholly in
admiration.  Yes, he loved her, or thought he did; and gazing
with him on the moonlit waves, when the solemn stars
shone serenely above him, he had told her so, and she had
believed him.  And she, wild, untutored child of nature,
who can tell the deep devotion, the intense passion, the
fiery, all-absorbing love for him that filled her impulsive
young heart?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Love was to her impassioned soul<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not, as to others, a mere part<br>
  Of her existence; but the whole&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very life-breath of her heart."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As she advanced, Willard Drummond started up,
saying, gayly:
</p>

<p>
"Welcome back, Miss Sibyl.  I thought the sunlight
had deserted us altogether; but you have brought it back
in your eyes."
</p>

<p>
"How's your patient, Sibyl?" said Captain Campbell,
who, not being in love, found Mr. Drummond's
high-flown compliments very tiresome sometimes.
</p>

<p>
"Much worse, I am afraid," she answered in a peculiarly
musical voice.  "I do not think he will live to see
the morrow's sun.  His ravings are frightful to
hear&mdash;some terrible crime seems to be weighing him down as
much as disease."
</p>

<p>
"After all, the human soul is an awful possession for
a guilty man," said Captain Campbell, thoughtfully.
"Things can be smoothed over during life, but when one
comes to die&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They feel what retributive justice is, I suppose," said
Drummond, in his customary careless tone; "and apropos
of that, somebody will suffer terrible remorse after I die.
I am to be murdered, if there is any truth in
fortune-telling."
</p>

<p>
He spoke lightly, with a half smile; but Sibyl's face
paled involuntarily as she exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Murdered, did you say?  Who could have predicted
anything so dreadful?"
</p>

<p>
"An old astrologer, or enchanter, or wizard of some
kind, in Germany, when I was there.  The affair seems so
improbable, so utterly absurd, in short, that I never like
to allude to it."
</p>

<p>
"You are not fool enough to believe such nonsense, I
hope," said Captain Campbell.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know as it is nonsense.  'There are more
things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in
philosophy,' you know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I was sure you would quote that; everyone
does that when he advances some absurd doctrine; but it's
all the greatest stuff, nevertheless."
</p>

<p>
"But did he tell you who you were to be&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Sibyl stopped short; even in jest she could not
pronounce the word.
</p>

<p>
"Murdered by?" said Willard, quietly finishing the
sentence for her.  "No, he told me nothing.  I saw it all."
</p>

<p>
"Saw it!  How?  I do not understand."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the story is hardly worth relating, and ought not
to be told in the presence of such a skeptic as Captain
Guy Campbell," said Drummond, running his fingers
lightly through his dark, glossy locks.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid I should wait to be inflicted by it!"
said Captain Campbell, starting up.  "I will relieve you
of my presence, and allow you to entertain my superstitious
sister here with your awful destiny, of which she
will doubtless believe every word."
</p>

<p>
"I should be sorry to believe anything so dreadful,"
said Sibyl, gravely; "but I do think there are some gifted
ones to whom the future has been revealed.  I wish I could
meet them, and find out what it has in store for me."
</p>

<p>
"Let me be your prophet," said Drummond, softly.
"Beautiful Sibyl, there can be nothing but bliss for an
angel like you."
</p>

<p>
Her radiant face flushed with pride, love, and triumph
at his words.
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe in omens?" she said, laughingly.
"See how brightly and beautifully yonder moon is rising!
Now, if it reaches the arch of heaven unclouded, I shall
believe your prediction."
</p>

<p>
Even as she spoke, a dense cloud passed athwart the
sky, and the moon was obscured in darkness.
</p>

<p>
The dark, bright face of Sibyl paled at the dread omen.
Involuntarily her eyes sought Drummond's who also had
been gazing at the sky.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven avert the omen!" she cried, with a shudder.
"Oh, Willard, the unclouded moon grew dark even while
I spoke."
</p>

<p>
"And now the cloud is past, and it sails on brighter
than ever," he said, with a smile.  "See, fairest Sibyl, all
is calm and peaceful once more.  My prediction will be
verified, after all."
</p>

<p>
She drew a deep breath, and looked so intensely
relieved that he laughed.  Sibyl blushed vividly, as she
said:
</p>

<p>
"I know you must think me weak and childish; but I
am superstitious by nature.  Dreams, inspirations, and
presentiments, that no one else thinks of, are all vivid
realities to me.  But you promised to tell me the German
wizard's prediction concerning your future, so, pray, go
on."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let me see," said Willard Drummond, leaning
his head on his hand.  "It is now three years ago that a
celebrated Egyptian fortune-teller visited the town in
Germany where I resided.  His fame soon spread far and
wide, and crowds of the incredulous came from every part
to visit him.  He could not speak a word of any language
but his own; but he had an interpreter who did all the
talking necessary, which was very little.
</p>

<p>
"I was then at a celebrated university; and, with two
or three of my fellow-students, resolved, one day, to visit
the wizard.  Arrived at his house, we were shown into a
large room, and called up one by one in the presence of
the Egyptian.
</p>

<p>
"Our object in going was more for sport than anything
else; but when we saw the first who was called&mdash;a
wild, reckless young fellow, who feared nothing
earthly&mdash;return pale and serious, our mirth was at an end.  One
by one the others were called, and all came back grave
and thoughtful.  By some chance, I was the last.
</p>

<p>
"I am not, like you, bright Sibyl, naturally superstitious;
but I confess, when the interpreter ushered me into
the presence of this wizard, I felt a sort of chilly awe
creeping over me.  He was the most singular-looking
being I ever beheld.  His face was exactly like that of
one who has been for some days dead&mdash;a sort of dark-greenish
white, with pale-blue lips, and sharp, Asiatic features.
His eyes, black and piercingly sharp, looked forth
from two deep caverns of sockets, and seemed the only
living feature in his ghastly face.  There were caldrons,
and lizards, and cross-bones, and tame serpents, and curious
devices carved on the walls, ceiling and floor, and the
white, grinning skulls that were scattered about formed a
hideously revolting sight in that darkened room.
</p>

<p>
"The Egyptian stood before a smoking caldron, and,
drawn up to his full height, his size appeared almost
colossal.  His dress was a long, black robe, all woven
over with scorpions, and snakes, and other equally pleasing
objects, that seemed starting out dazzlingly white from
this dark background.  Altogether, the room looked so
like a charnel-house, and the wizard so like a supernatural
being, that I am not ashamed to own I felt myself
growing nervous as I looked around.
</p>

<p>
"The interpreter, who stood behind, opened the scene
by asking me my name, age, birthplace, and divers other
questions of a like nature, which he wrote down in some
sort of hieroglyphics and handed to the Egyptian.  Then
bidding me advance and keep my eyes fixed on the caldron
and not speak a word, the interpreter left the room.
</p>

<p>
"My heart beat faster than was its wont as I approached
this strange being, and found myself completely alone
with him in this ghostly, weird place.  He took a handful
of what I imagined to be incense of some kind, and threw
it on the red, living coals, muttering some strange sounds
in an unknown tongue as he did so.  Presently a cloud
of smoke arose, dense, black, and suffocating, filling the
whole room with the gloom of Tartarus.  Slowly, as if
endowed with instinct, it lifted itself up and spread out
before me.  And, looking up, I beheld&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond paused, as if irresolute whether to
reveal the rest or not; but Sibyl grasped his arm, and in
a voice that was fairly hoarse with intense excitement,
said:
</p>

<p>
"Go on."
</p>

<p>
"I saw," he continued, looking beyond her, as if
describing something then passing before him, "the interior
of a church thronged with people.  Flowers were strewn
along the aisles, and I seemed to hear faintly the grand
cadences of a triumphal hymn.  A clergyman, book in
hand, stood before a bridal pair, performing the marriage
ceremony.  The features of the man of God are indelibly
impressed on my memory, but the two who stood before
him had their backs toward me.  For about five seconds
they remained thus stationary, then it began to grow more
indistinct; the forms grew shadowy and undefined, and
began to disappear.  Just before they vanished altogether,
the faces of the wedded pair turned for an instant toward
me, and in the bridegroom, Sibyl, I beheld myself.  The
vapor lifted and lifted, until all was gone, and nothing
was to be seen but the black walls of the room and the
glowing, fiery coals in the caldron.
</p>

<p>
"Again the Egyptian threw the incense on the fire,
and again mumbled his unintelligible jargon.  Again the
thick, black smoke arose, filling the room; and again
became stationary, forming a shadowy panorama before
me.  This time I saw a prison-cell&mdash;dark, dismal, and
noisome.  A rough straw pallet stood on one side, and on the
other a pitcher of water and a loaf&mdash;orthodox prison fare
from time immemorial.  On the ground, chained to the
wall, groveled a woman, in shining bridal robes, her long
midnight tresses trailing on the foul floor.  No words can
describe to you the utter despair and mortal anguish
depicted in her crouching attitude.  I stood spell-bound
to the spot, unable to move, in breathless interest.  Then
the scene began to fade away; the prostrate figure lifted
its head, and I beheld the face of her whom a moment
before seemed to stand beside me at the altar.  But no
words of mine can describe to you the mortal woe, the
unutterable despair, in that haggard but beautiful face.
Sibyl!  Sibyl! it will haunt me to my dying day.  I put
out my hand, as if to retain her, but in that instant all
disappeared."
</p>

<p>
Once more Willard Drummond paused; this time he
was deadly pale, and his eyes were wild and excited.
Sibyl stood near him, her great black, mystic eyes dilated,
every trace of color fading from her face, leaving even her
lips as pale as death.
</p>

<p>
"The third time this strange enchanter went through
the same ceremony as before," continued he; "and, as in
the previous cases, a new scene appeared before me.  Now,
the time appeared to be night; and the place, a dark,
lonesome wood.  A furious storm of lightning, and thunder,
and rain, was raging, and the trees creaked and bent in
the fierce wind.  On the ground lay the dead body of a
man weltering in blood.  A dark, crimson stream flowed
from a great, frightful gash in his head, from which the
life seemed just to have gone.  As the white face of the
murdered man was upturned to the light&mdash;cut, bloody, and
disfigured as it was&mdash;Sibyl, I recognized <i>myself</i> once more,
As Heaven hears me, I saw it as plainly as I see yonder
pale, fair moon now.  A white, ghostly form, whether of
woman or spirit I know not, seemed hovering near, darting,
as it were, in and out amid the trees.  Even as I gazed,
it grew thin and shadowy, until all was gone again.
</p>

<p>
"For the fourth and last time, the Egyptian threw a
strange incense on the fire, and 'spoke the words of power,"
and a new vision met my horrified gaze.  I seemed to
behold an immense concourse of people, a vast mob,
swaying to and fro in the wildest excitement.  A low, hoarse
growl, as of distant thunder, passed at intervals through
the vast crowd, and every eye was raised to an object above
them.  I looked up, too, and beheld a sight that seemed
freezing the very blood in my veins.  It was a <i>scaffold</i>;
and standing on it, with the ignominious halter round her
white, beautiful neck, was she who had stood beside me at
the altar, whom I had seen chained in her prison-cell,
doomed to die by the hand of the public hangman now.
Her beautiful hands were stretched out wildly, imploringly,
to the crowd below, who only hooted her in her
agony and despair.  The executioner led her to the fatal
drop, a great shout arose from the crowd, then all faded
away; and looking up, as if from an appalling dream, I
saw the interpreter beckoning me from the door.  How I
reeled from the room, with throbbing brow and feverish
pulse, I know not.  Everything seemed swimming around
me; and, in a state of the wildest excitement, I was
hurried home by my companions.
</p>

<p>
"The next day the Egyptian left the city, and where
he went after, I never heard.
</p>

<p>
"Such was the glimpse of the future I beheld.  It
was many months after before I completely recovered
from the shock I received.  How to account for it I do
not know.  Certain I am that I beheld it, truly, as I have
told it in every particular, for the impression it made
upon me at the time was so powerful that everything
connected with it is indelibly engraven on my memory.  It
may seem strange, absurd, impossible; but that I have
nothing to do with; I only know I <i>saw</i> it, incredible as it
seems.  But, good heaven!  Sibyl, dearest, are you
ill&mdash;fainting!"
</p>

<p>
Pale, trembling, and excited, the once fearless Sibyl
Campbell clung to his arm, white with vague, sickening
horror.  Superstitious to an unusual degree, an awful
presentiment had clutched her heart; and, for a moment
she seemed dying in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl!  Sibyl! my dearest love!" he said, in alarm,
"what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing&mdash;nothing," she answered, in a tremulous
voice; "but, oh, Willard! do you believe the prediction?"
</p>

<p>
"Strange, wild girl that you are! has this idle talk
frightened you so?" he said, smiling at her wild, dilated
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"If it should prove true," she said, covering her face
with a shudder.  "Willard, tell me&mdash;<i>do</i> you believe it?"
</p>

<p>
"My dark-eyed darling, how can I tell whether to
believe it or not?  It has not come true, and there seems
no likelihood of its ever doing so.  Do not think of it
any more; if I had thought it would have unnerved you
so, I would never have told you."
</p>

<p>
"But, Willard, did any of his other predictions prove
true?"
</p>

<p>
"I would rather not answer that question, Sibyl," he
said, while a cloud darkened for a moment his fine face.
</p>

<p>
"You <i>must</i> tell me," she cried, starting up, and looking
at him with her large, lustrous eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then&mdash;yes," said Drummond, reluctantly.
"Young Vaughn, one of those who accompanied me, saw
a funeral procession, and himself robed for the grave
lying in the coffin.  Five weeks after, he was accidentally
shot."
</p>

<p>
She put up her arm in a vague, wild sort of way, as if
to ward off some approaching danger.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! this is dreadful&mdash;dreadful!  What if
all he predicted should come to pass!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I should be obliged to do the best I could.
What will be, will be&mdash;you know.  But I have no such
fear.  Nonsense, Sibyl! a Campbell of the Isle trembling
thus at imaginary danger!&mdash;the ghost of Guy the Fearless
will start from his grave, if he discovers it!"
</p>

<p>
The color came proudly back to her cheek at his
bantering words, as she said, more coldly and calmly:
</p>

<p>
"For myself, I could never tremble; but for&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She paused, and her beautiful lip quivered.
</p>

<p>
"For me, then, dear love, those fears are," he said
tenderly.  "A thousand thanks for this proof of your love:
but, believe me, the cause is only imaginary.  Why, Sibyl,
I had nearly forgotten all about the matter, until your
brother's remark to-night recalled it to my memory.
Promise me, now, you will never think of it more&mdash;much
less speak of it."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me one thing more, Willard, and I promise&mdash;only
one," said Sibyl, laying her hand on his shoulder, and
looking up in his face earnestly, while her voice trembled
in spite of all her efforts.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Did you recognize the face of the person whom you
saw beside you at the altar, and who afterward died on
I the scaffold?"
</p>

<p>
He was silent, and looked with a troubled eye out
over the shining waters.
</p>

<p>
"Willard, dearest Willard! tell me, have you, ever yet
seen her?"
</p>

<p>
"Why will you question me thus, dearest Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
"Answer me truly, Willard, on your honor."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, dearest, I have."
</p>

<p>
Sibyl drew her breath quick and short, and held his
arm with a convulsive grasp.
</p>

<p>
"Who is she?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Willard turned, and looking steadily into her wild,
searching eyes, replied, in a thrilling whisper:
</p>

<p>
</p>

CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
THE MANIAC'S CURSE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Her wretched brain gave way,<br>
  And she became a wreck at random driven,<br>
  Without one glimpse of reason or of heaven."&mdash;LALLA ROOKH.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The schooner Evening Star lay at anchor in a little
rock-bound inlet, on the northern side of the island
previously referred to.  A boat had just put off from
her, containing Captain Guy Campbell, Mr. Willard
Drummond, Sibyl Campbell, and the sick passenger, Richard
Grove.  He lay on a sort of mattress, half supported by
Captain Campbell; and in the pale, cold moonlight, looked wan
and emaciated to a fearful degree.  The features, sharply
defined, were like those of a skeleton, and, in their ghastly
rigidity, seemed like those of a corpse.  But life, intensely
burning life, shone in the wild, troubled eyes.  Willard
Drummond and Sibyl sat talking together, in low tones,
at the other end of the boat, fearful of disturbing the
dying man.
</p>

<p>
As the boat touched the shore, Drummond leaped out,
and extended his hand to Sibyl; but the wild sea-nymph,
declining the needless aid, sprang lightly out, and stood
beside him.
</p>

<p>
The figure of a woman, who had been standing on a
rock, watching their approach, now came forward,
exclaiming delightedly:
</p>

<p>
"Laws-a-massy, Miss Sibyl!  Who ever s'posed we'd
see you here again?  Where hev you been to this long
time?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Mrs. Tom!" said Sibyl, smilingly, holding
out her hand; "I am delighted to see you.  Where I have
been is a troublesome question to answer, seeing I have
been almost everywhere you could mention."
</p>

<p>
"Laws, now! hev you?  'Spect you had nice times
sailin' round, though it does seem odd how you could
stand all the sea-sickness you must have come through.
'Tain' every young critter would do it.  But then you allus
was different from most young folks.  Jemimi! how you've
growed, an' how handsome you've got!  Jest as pooty as
a picter!  An' that, I s'pose, is young Master Guy!"
continued the loquacious new-comer, eagerly, as the young
captain leaped lightly ashore.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl nodded, and blushed slightly, as she encountered
the gaze of Drummond, who stood watching Mrs. Tom,
with a half-smile of amusement on his fine face.
</p>

<p>
"Master Guy!" said the officious Mrs. Tom, bustling
forward; "you hain't forgotten your old aunty, I hope?
My gracious! you've got as tall as a hop-pole!  Growed
out of my knowledge altogether!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mrs. Tom, is it possible?" exclaimed Captain
Guy, catching her hand in his hearty grasp.  "Looking as
young and smart as ever, too, and as fresh and breezy as
a May morning!  'Pon my word, I'm delighted to see
you looking so well!  How is pretty Christie and Master
Carl?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Christie is well enough, and pootier than ever;
and, what's more, she's as good as she's handsome.  But
Carl&mdash;oh, Master Guy! that there young limb'll break my
heart yet!  I hain't the slightest doubt of it.  Of all the
thrif'less, good-for-nothing lazy-bones&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, Mrs. Tom, he'll outgrow that.  The best
thing you can do is to let me take him to sea with me the
next time I go, and that will cure him of his laziness, if
anything will.  In the meantime, I have a patient for you
to take care of, if you have no objection.  He can't last
much longer, poor fellow, and you are a better nurse than
Sibyl.  What do you say, Mrs. Tom?  Shall I send him
up to your house?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom was a brown faced, black-eyed, keen-looking,
wide-awake, gossiping little woman, of four feet
high, with a tongue that could, and did, say sharp things
sometimes; but with a heart so warm and large that it is
a wonder how it ever found room in so small a body.
However, I have been told, as a general thing, little
people are, by far, cleverer and warmer-hearted than their
tall neighbors&mdash;as if nature were anxious to atone for
their shortened stature by giving them a double allowance
of heart and brains.
</p>

<p>
Nursing was Mrs. Tom's peculiar element.  Nothing
delighted her more than to get possession of a patient,
whom she could doctor back to health.  But unfortunately
this desire of her heart was seldom gratified; for
both Carl and Christie were so distressingly healthy that
"yarb tea" and "chicken broth" were only thrown away
upon them.  Her frequent visits to the mainland,
however, afforded her an opportunity of physicking
indiscriminately certain unfortunate little wretches, who were
always having influenza, and measles, and hooping-cough,
and other little complaints too numerous to mention, and
which fled before Mrs. Tom's approach and the power of
her "yarb tea."  Of late there had been a "plentiful
scarcity" even of these escape-valves, so her eyes twinkled
now with their delight at the prospect of this godsend.
</p>

<p>
"Send him up?  Sartinly you will, Master Guy.  I'll
take care of him.  This here's the best road up to the side
of the rocks; 'tain't so rough as it is here."
</p>

<p>
"Lift him up," said Captain Campbell to the sailors
who had rowed them ashore, "Gently, boys," he said, as
the sick man groaned.  "Don't hurt him.  Follow Mrs. Tom
to her cottage&mdash;that's the way.  I'll be down early
to-morrow to see him, Mrs. Tom.  This way, Drummond;
follow me.  I'll bid you good-night, Mrs. Tom.  Remember
me to Christie."
</p>

<p>
And Captain Campbell sprang up the rocks, followed
by Sibyl and Drummond, in the direction of Campbell's
Castle.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom, with a rapidity which the two sturdy seamen
found it difficult to follow, burdened as they were,
walked toward her cottage.
</p>

<p>
The home of Mrs. Tom was a low, one-story house,
consisting of one large room and bed-room, with a loft
above, where all sorts of lumber and garden implements
were thrown, and where Master Carl sought his repose.
A garden in front, and a well-graveled path, led up to the
front door, and into the apartment which served as
kitchen, parlor, dining-room, and sleeping-room for
Christie and Mrs. Tom.  The furniture was of the plainest
description, and scanty at that, for Mrs. Tom was poor,
in spite of all her industry; but, as might be expected
from so thrifty a housewife, everything was like
waxwork.  The small, diamond-shaped panes in the windows
flashed like jewels in the moonlight; and the floors and
chairs were scrubbed as white as human hands could make
them.  Behind the house was a large vegetable garden,
nominally cultivated by Carl, but really by Mrs. Tom,
who preferred doing the work herself to watching her
lazy nephew.
</p>

<p>
As the men entered with their burden, Mrs. Tom threw
open the bed-room door, and the sick man was deposited
on the bed.  Lights were brought by Carl, a round-faced,
yellow-haired, sleepy-looking youth, of fifteen, with dull,
unmeaning blue eyes, and a slow, indolent gait; the
very opposite in every way of his brisk, bustling little aunt.
</p>

<p>
"Be off with you to bed!" said Mrs. Tom.  "It's the
best place for any one so lazy as you are.  Clear out,
now, for I'm going to sit up with this here sick man, and
want quiet."
</p>

<p>
With evident willingness Carl shuffled off, leaving
Mrs. Tom alone with her patient.
</p>

<p>
The little woman approached the bed, and looked at
his pinched, sallow features with an experienced eye.  It
was evident to her he could not survive the night.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if he knows his end's so near at hand?"
said Mrs. Tom to herself.  "He ought to know, anyhow.
I'll tell him when he awakes, 'cause it's no use for me
trying to do anything with him."
</p>

<p>
The man was not asleep.  As she spoke he opened his
large, wild-looking black eyes, and gazed around vacantly.
</p>

<p>
"Mister," began Mrs. Tom, "I don't know your name,
but 'taint no odds.  Do you know how long you have to
live?"
</p>

<p>
"How long?" said the man, looking at her with a
gaze so wild that, had Mrs. Tom been the least bit
nervous, would have terrified her beyond measure.
</p>

<p>
"Not three hours," said Mrs. Tom gravely.
</p>

<p>
A sort of wild horror overspread the face of the dying
man.
</p>

<p>
"So soon! oh, Heaven, so soon!" he murmured, "and
with all unconfessed still.  I cannot die with this crime
on my soul.  I must reveal the miserable secret that has
eaten away my very life."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom listened to this unexpected outburst in wonder
and amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," said the man, turning to Mrs. Tom, and
speaking rapidly in his excitement.  "One night, about
thirteen years ago, as I was returning home from my
day's labor, I was overtaken by a violent storm.  I was a
considerable distance from home, and there was no house
near where I could remain for the night.  It was intensely
dark, and I staggered blindly along in the drenching rain
until, by a sudden flash of lightning, I chanced to espy the
ruins of an old house, that had long been deserted.  Thankful
even for this refuge from the storm, I entered it, and,
retreating into a corner, I sat on an empty box waiting
for the tempest to abate.
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly I heard the sound of voices in an adjoining
room, talking in low whispers.  There were, at the time,
certain suspicious characters prowling about, and the
unexpected sound startled me.  Still, I felt they might be
only weather-bound wayfarers, like myself; but, before
joining them, I thought it might be prudent to discover
who they were, and I cautiously drew near the wall to
listen.
</p>

<p>
"The partition dividing us was thin, and in the lull of
the storm I could catch here and there a few words of
their conversation.
</p>

<p>
"'I tell you he killed himself,' said one.  'I saw him.
He stabbed him to the heart with his knife.'
</p>

<p>
"'What does he intend doing with&mdash;?'  Here a sudden
rush of wind and rain prevented me from hearing what
followed.
</p>

<p>
"'And serves the jade right, too,' were the next words
I heard.  'She might have known what it was to rouse the
anger of that devil incarnate.'
</p>

<p>
"'Where are we to find this fellow he wants?' said
the second voice.
</p>

<p>
"'At Minton, on the coast, half a mile from here.  His
name's Dick Grove.  I know him.'
</p>

<p>
"I started in alarm, as well I might, for the name was
mine.
</p>

<p>
"'How do you know he'll agree?'
</p>

<p>
"'If he doesn't, said the first, with an oath that made
my blood run chill, 'a little cold steel will settle the
business.  But the terms are easier than that; he's to be well
paid for holding his tongue, and as he's a poor devil, he'll
do anything for money.  Oh, he'll agree; there's no
trouble about that.'
</p>

<p>
"The increasing noise of the storm now drowned their
voices altogether.  I stood for a moment rooted to the
ground with terror.  That some terrible crime had been,
or was to be perpetrated, in which, by some means, I was
to be implicated, I plainly saw; and my only idea now
was to escape.  I started forward, but, as my unlucky fate
would have it, I stumbled in the darkness and fell heavily
to the ground with a violence that shook the old house.
</p>

<p>
"I heard, as I lay half stunned, an ejaculation of alarm
from the inner room and quick footsteps approaching
where I lay.  All was now up with me, so I scrambled to
my feet just as two men, wearing black crape masks over
their faces, entered.  Each carried pistols, and one held a
dark-lantern, the light of which flashed in my face.
</p>

<p>
"'Who are you, sir?' fiercely exclaimed one; and I
saw him draw a sword that made my blood curdle.
</p>

<p>
"I essayed to answer, but my teeth chattered so with
terror that I could not utter a word.
</p>

<p>
"'Ha!' exclaimed the other, who all this time had been
holding the lantern close to my face.  'This is the very
fellow we were in search of.  Your name is Richard
Grove?'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes,' I managed to say, quaking with mortal fear.
</p>

<p>
"'You are a mason by trade, and live in Minton?'
said, or rather affirmed, my fierce questioner.
</p>

<p>
"I replied in the affirmative, for I saw there was no
use in attempting a lie.
</p>

<p>
"'All right, Tom.  You go for the carriage; I will
take care of our friend here until you return.'
</p>

<p>
"The one with the knife left the house, and the other,
drawing a pistol, the disagreeable click of which made me
jump, sat down before me, keeping his eyes immovably
riveted on my face.  I did not dare to move.  I scarcely
dared to breathe, as I stood with my eyes fixed, as if
fascinated, on the deadly weapon.  Nearly ten minutes passed
thus in profound silence, when the sound of carriage-wheels
was heard; and the instant after, the man called
Tom entered, his mask off, but his hat pulled so far down
over his eyes, and his coat-collar turned so far up, that I
could see nothing but a pair of dark, sinister eyes.
</p>

<p>
"'The carriage is here,' he said.
</p>

<p>
"'Then go on; and you, my man, follow him&mdash;I will
walk behind.'
</p>

<p>
"I did not venture to utter a word, and was about
going out, when he called me back, exclaiming;
</p>

<p>
"'I came near forgetting a very necessary precaution.
Here, my good fellow, let me tie this bandage over your
eyes.'
</p>

<p>
"'Where are you taking me to?' I ventured to say, as
he very coolly proceeded to tie a handkerchief tightly over
my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"'That you had better not know.  And hark ye, friend,
ask no questions.  Least said soonest mended.  Move on,
Tom.'
</p>

<p>
"Holding my hand to prevent me from falling, my
guide led me out.  I felt myself assisted into a carriage
and placed in a seat.  One of the men got in after me,
and closed the door; the other mounted the box, and off
we drove.
</p>

<p>
"I am quite sure they took a long, roundabout way
and went here and there, in various directions, and came
back to the same place again, to make me believe the
distance was much longer than it really was.  For nearly
an hour we drove thus, and then the coach stopped, and I
was helped out.  I knew I was on the shore, for I could
hear the waves dashing inward, and foaming and breaking
over the rocks.  Then they assisted me into a boat,
which was pushed off and rowed rapidly away.  The boat
was large and strong, but it tossed and pitched dreadfully
in the heaving sea, and I was forced to hold on with the
grasp of desperation to the side.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure we were fully two hours, tossing thus on
the surf, when the boat struck the shore so suddenly, that
I was thrown forward on my face in the bottom.  With a
loud laugh of derision, the men helped me up and assisted
me to land, and then conducted me up a long, slippery
beach until we reached a hard road.  We walked rapidly
on for nearly a quarter of an hour, and then I heard a
key turn in a rusty lock, and I was led into a house.
Taking first the precaution of locking the door after him,
my guide led me through a long hall, up a longer winding
staircase, and through another hall, and up two other
flights of stairs.  It seemed to me he would never stop,
when, at last, I heard him open a door, thrust me in, and
retreat again, locking the door after him.
</p>

<p>
"My first care was to tear off the bandage and look
around; but the room was so intensely black I could see
nothing.  The darkness could be almost felt as I thrust
out my hand and essayed to walk.  I had not advanced a
dozen steps, when my foot slipped on some wet, slimy
substance, and I fell, and struck violently against
something lying on the floor.  Trembling with horror, I put
out my hand, and&mdash;merciful Heaven!  I shudder even now
to think of it&mdash;it fell on the cold, clammy face of a
corpse!"
</p>

<p>
"Laws-a-massy!" ejaculated the horror-struck Mrs. Tom,
as the dying man paused, every feature convulsed
at the recollection.
</p>

<p>
"I think I fainted," he went on, after a pause, "for
when I next recollect anything, I was supported by my
masked conductor, who was sprinkling, or, rather,
dashing handfuls of water in my face, and there was a light
burning in the room.  I looked around.  There, on the
floor, lay the dead body of a man, weltering in blood,
which flowed from a great, frightful gash in his side!"
</p>

<p>
"The sight nearly drove me mad, for I sprang with a
wild cry to my feet.  But my conductor laid his hand on
my shoulder and said, in a tone so fierce and stern that I
quailed before him:
</p>

<p>
"Hark ye, sirrah, have done with this cowardly foolery,
or, by heaven, you shall share the same fate of him
you see before you!  No matter what you see to-night,
speak not, nor ask any questions, under peril of instant
death.  If you perform your duty faithfully, this shall be
your reward."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he displayed a purse filled up with bright,
yellow guineas.
</p>

<p>
"Before I could reply, a shriek that seemed to come
from below resounded through the room, a shriek so full
of wild horror, and anguish, and despair, that even my
companion gave a violent start, and stood as if listening
intently.  As for me, my very life-blood seemed curdling
as the wild, piercing cries of agony came nearer and nearer.
A heavy footstep ascended the stairs, and I could hear the
sound of some body being dragged up.
</p>

<p>
"Closer and closer came those appalling screams, and
a man entered, masked likewise, dragging after him the
convulsed form of a young girl.
</p>

<p>
"To this day I have never seen a more beautiful creature,
notwithstanding her face was distorted with fear and
horror.  As she entered, her eyes fell on the form of the
dead man on the floor.  With supernatural strength she
broke from the man who held her, and bent for an instant
over the lifeless body.  It sufficed to tell her he was quite
dead; and then, throwing up her white arms, she fled
round the room, shrieking as I never heard any living
being shriek before.  Great Heaven! those awful cries
are ringing in my ears yet.
</p>

<p>
"The man who had led her in sprang forward and caught
her by both wrists.  She struggled like one mad, but even
the unnatural strength of frenzy failed to free her from
his iron grasp.  I could see her delicate wrists grow black
in the cruel grasp in which he held her.
</p>

<p>
"The man beside me said something to him in a foreign
tongue&mdash;French, I think&mdash;to which the other nodded,
without speaking.  My guide then went and unlocked a
door at the farther end of the apartment, from which
he drew forth a great heap of bricks and mortar, and all
the implements necessary for building a wall.
</p>

<p>
"A light began to dawn upon me.  The body of this
murdered man was to be walled up here.
</p>

<p>
"My suspicion was correct.  Making a sign for me to
assist him, the man raised the head, and not daring to
refuse, I took the body by the feet, and we carried it into
the inner room, which proved to be a small dark closet
without a window, and with immensely thick walls.  Even
in my terror for my own safety, I could not repress a
feeling of pity for this murdered youth&mdash;for he was only
a boy&mdash;and the handsomest I ever saw.
</p>

<p>
"All this time the woman's wild shrieks were resounding
through the room, growing louder and louder each
moment, as she still struggled to free herself from his
hold.  All in vain.  He forced her into the inner room,
but before he could close the door she had burst out,
and, clasping his knees, screamed for mercy.
</p>

<p>
"He spurned her from him with a kick of his heavy
boot, and then she sprang up and spat at him like one
possessed of an evil spirit.  Flying to the farthest
corner of the room, she raised her right hand to Heaven,
crying, in a voice that might have made the stoutest
heart quail:
</p>

<p>
"'I curse you!  I curse you!  Living, may Heaven's
wrath follow my curse&mdash;dead, may it hurl you into eternal
perdition!  On your children and on your children's
children, may&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"With a fierce oath, he sprang upon her ere she could
finish the awful words that pealed through the room
like the last trump, and seizing her by the throat, hurled
her headlong into the dark inner room where the murdered
man lay.  Then, closing the massive oaken door, and
locking it, he turned to me, and speaking for the first
time, commanded me, in a voice fairly convulsed with
passion, to wall up the door.
</p>

<p>
"I would have prayed for mercy, but my tongue clove
to the roof of my mouth.  The man beside me saw my
indecision, and, catching me by the arm, said, in a stern
whisper:
</p>

<p>
"Fool! do you want to share their fate?  Do as you
are told!
</p>

<p>
"I shrank from the crime, but life was dear to me, and
I obeyed.  As men work only for their lives, I worked
with those two mysterious masks looking on.  All was
still as the grave within that closet-door now.  Once only
I heard a sound as of some one trying to rise, and then a
heavy fall&mdash;and I worked on with redoubled energy.
</p>

<p>
"Not a word was spoken by any of us in the deep
silence of the solemn midnight, in which the awful crime
was perpetrated.
</p>

<p>
"It was completed at last; where the door had been
was a wall of solid masonry, which her death-cries could
never penetrate.
</p>

<p>
"'It is well!' said he who appeared to me the superior.
'Give him the reward I told you of.'
</p>

<p>
"The other silently handed me the purse.
</p>

<p>
"'And now swear never to reveal what you have this
night seen till your dying day!'
</p>

<p>
"'I swear!' said I, for I dared not refuse.
</p>

<p>
"'That will do.  Take him away,' said the speaker,
leaving the room.
</p>

<p>
"My guide blindfolded me as I had been before, and
led me out, locking the door on the awful secret.
</p>

<p>
"As I had been brought up, I was led to the beach.
The boat was in waiting, and I was taken away, landed,
conveyed into the carriage, which for upward of half an
hour drove round some circuitous route.  Then I was
assisted out and left standing alone.  I tore the bandage
from my eyes and looked around, but the carriage was
gone; and I never heard or discovered aught more of the
event of that night.
</p>

<p>
"From that day my peace of mind was gone.  Years
passed, but it haunted me night and day, till I became a
morose and dreaded man.  Then I traveled from land to
land, but nothing ever could banish from my ears that
woman's dying shrieks and despairing eyes.
</p>

<p>
"In Liverpool I felt ill.  I felt I mast die, and wanted
to come and be buried in my native land.  Captain Campbell
brought me here.  And now that I have told all, I can
die in peace.  In peace&mdash;never! never until that woman's
face is gone!  Oh, Heaven!" he cried, raising himself
up with a shriek, and pointing to the window, "<i>she is there!</i>"
</p>

<p>
With a scream almost as wild as his own, Mrs. Tom
started up and looked.
</p>

<p>
A pale, wild, woeful face, shrouded in wild black hair,
was glued for a moment to the glass, and then was gone.
</p>

<p>
Paralyzed with terror, Mrs. Tom turned to the sick
man.  His jaw had dropped, his eyes were protruding
from their sockets, and he was <i>dead</i>.

CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE HAUNTED ROOM.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What form is that?<br>
  The stony clenching of the bared teeth&mdash;<br>
  The gory socket that the balls have burst from&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see them all,<br>
  It moves&mdash;-it moves&mdash;it rises&mdash;it comes on me."&mdash;BERTRAM.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Under the guidance of young Guy Campbell,
Willard Drummond and Sibyl ascended the steep
rocky path leading to Campbell Lodge.  Captain
Guy bounded over the rocks with the agility of a
deer, while his two companions more leisurely followed.
</p>

<p>
"Yonder is my island-home, old Campbell Castle,"
said Sibyl, as an abrupt turn in the rough road brought
them full in view of the mansion-house.  "It is nearly
three years now since I have seen it."
</p>

<p>
Both paused as if involuntarily to contemplate it.  Years
and neglect had performed their usual work of destruction
on the lodge.  The windows were broken in many
places, and the great gate before the house, hung useless
and fallen off it rusty hinges.  The coarse, red sandstone
of which it had been originally built, was now black with
age and the many storms that had beat against it.  No
lights were to be seen, no smoke issued from the tall
chimneys, all looked black, gloomy and deserted.  The
swallows had built their nests in the eaves and ruined
gables, and even the tall, dark, spectral pines that formed
an avenue to the dilapidated gate-way, had a forlorn and
dismal look.  In the pale, bright moonlight, the ruined
homestead of the Campbells looked cold, bleak, and
uninviting.  Even the long, gloomy shadows from the
trees, as they lay on the ground, seemed to the superstitious
mind of Sibyl, like unearthly hands waving them
away.   She shuddered with a chill feeling of dread, and
clung closer to the arm of Drummond:
</p>

<p>
"Quite a remarkable looking old place, this," said the
young man, gayly.  "Really charming in its gloomy
grandeur, and highly suggestive of ghosts and rats, and
other vermin of a like nature," while he inwardly
muttered: "Dismal old hole; even Sibyl's bright eyes can
hardly recompense me for burying myself in such a
rickety dungeon."
</p>

<p>
"It has not a very hospitable look, I must say," said
its young mistress, with a smile; "but in spite of its
forbidding aspect, I hope we will be able, by some means,
to make your stay here endurable."
</p>

<p>
"A desert would seem a paradise to me with you near
by," said Drummond, in his low, lover-like tones.  "My
only regret is, that our stay here is destined to be so
short."
</p>

<p>
The dark, bright face of the young island-girl flushed
with pleasure; but ere she could reply, the hall-door was
thrown open, and Captain Campbell stood, hat in hand,
before them.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome to Campbell Castle," he said, with gay
courtesy, stepping aside to let them enter.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Drummond, bowing gravely, while
he glanced with some curiosity around, to see if the
interior looked more inviting than the exterior.
</p>

<p>
They stood in a long, wide hall, high and spacious,
which the light of the flickering candle Captain Campbell
held strove in vain to illuminate.  At the further
extremity a winding staircase rose up, until it was lost in the
gloom above.  Two wide, black doors flanked the hall on
either side, and Captain Campbell threw open that on the
right, saying:
</p>

<p>
"This I have discovered, upon investigation to be at
present the only habitable apartment in the house.
Woeful are the accounts I have received from worthy Aunt
Moll and her son and heir, Lemuel, of the state of the
chimneys.  The swallows have built their nests in the
only one that ever did draw respectably, and all the rest
leak at such a rate every time it rains that the fire is not
only completely extinguished, but the rooms filled with
water."
</p>

<p>
"And what in the world are we to do, brother?" asked
Sibyl, in dismay at this unpromising picture.
</p>

<p>
"Why, we must make the best we can of a bad bargain.
I have sent Lem&mdash;much against his will, I must
say, for the young man is disagreeably afflicted with
laziness&mdash;to take the swallows' nests out of the chimney and
make a fire there, while Aunt Moll does all the other et
ceteras necessary for receiving as its inmate Her Majesty
the Queen of the Isle.  Then, as there is but one other
habitable room in the house, Signor Drummond must
occupy it, although it has not the most pleasant reputation
in the world."
</p>

<p>
"How is that?" asked Drummond, drawing up a chair
and seating himself in front of the fire, that, thanks to the
exertions of Captain Campbell, was already burning
brightly on the hearth.
</p>

<p>
"Why, to tell the truth, Aunt Moll and her hopeful son
assert it to be haunted, as it most probably is by rats.
If you are willing to trust yourself to the ghost's mercy,
I can freely promise you safety from all other dangers."
</p>

<p>
"Haunted?  By Jove, that's capital!  I have been
wishing all my life to see a genuine ghost, and lo! the
time has come at last.  But what manner of ghost is it,
saith the legend&mdash;fair or foul, old or young, handsome or
hideous?"
</p>

<p>
"On that point I am distressingly short of information.
Lem's description is rather vague.  He describes it as
being 'higher than anything at all, with fire coming out of
its eyes, long hair reaching to the ground, and dressed in
white.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course!" said Drummond.  "Who ever heard
of a ghost that wasn't dressed in white?  'Pon my honor,
I am quite enchanted at the opportunity of making the
acquaintance of its ghostship."
</p>

<p>
During this conversation Sibyl had left the room "on
hospitable thoughts intent," and now returned to announce
that supper was already progressing rapidly&mdash;most
welcome news to our hungry gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl had taken off her hat, and now her raven curls
fell in heavy tresses to her waist.  In the shadow, those
glittering ringlets looked intensely black; but where the
firelight fell upon them, a sort of red light shone through.
</p>

<p>
As she moved through the high, shadowy rooms, with
the graceful, airy motion that lent a charm to the
commonest action, Willard Drummond, following her with
his eyes, felt a secret sense of exultation, as he thought
this magnificent creature was his, and his alone.  This
bright, impassioned sea-nymph; this beautiful, radiant
daughter of a noble race; this royal, though dowerless
island-queen, loved him above all created beings.  Had
she not told him as he whispered in her willing ear his
passionate words of love, that he was dearer to her than
all the world besides?  Some day he would make her his
wife, and take her with him to his princely home in
Virginia; and he thought, with new exultation, of the
sensation this glorious planet would make among the lesser
stars of his native State.
</p>

<p>
So thought and argued Willard Drummond in the
first flush and delirium of love.
</p>

<p>
He did not stop to think that he had loved with even
more intensity once before; that he had raved even in a
like manner of another far less bright than this queenly
Sibyl.  He did not stop to think that even so he might
love again.
</p>

<p>
No.  Everything was forgotten but the intoxicating
girl before him, with her sparkling face, her glorious eyes
of jet, and her flashing, sun-bright hair.
</p>

<p>
From the rhapsody of passion&mdash;from the seventh heaven
of his day-dreams, he was at last recalled by the voice of
Sibyl herself summoning him to supper.
</p>

<p>
He looked up with a start, half inclined to be provoked
at this sudden summons from his ideal world to the vulgar
reality of a supper of hot-cakes, tea, and preserves.
But there sat Sibyl at the head of the table, bright and
smiling&mdash;beautifying even the dull routine of the tea-table
with the charm of her presence.  And then, too&mdash;now
that this airy vision was gone&mdash;Mr. Willard Drummond
began to recollect that he was very hungry, and that
"dreams and visions" were, after all, very unsubstantial
things, compared with the bread and butter of every-day
life, degrading as the confession was.
</p>

<p>
Guy had already taken his place, so Willard took the
seat his young host pointed out to him, and the business
of the tea-table commenced.
</p>

<p>
When the meal was over, Aunt Moll cleared the table,
and the three gathered round the fire&mdash;for, though the
weather was warm, the great unaired room was chill
enough to render the fire pleasant.
</p>

<p>
By degrees, perhaps it was owing to the strange, dreary
loneliness of the place, the conversation turned upon
deserted houses, bold robberies, murders, and by a natural
consequence, upon ghosts.
</p>

<p>
Willard and Captain Campbell seemed striving to outvie
each other in telling the most frightful tales, the
latter taxing his imagination to invent them, when the
original failed to produce the necessary degree of horror.
Every one knows what a strange fascination such ghostly
legends have, the hours passed almost unnoticed, and it
was only when the fire burned low on the hearth, and the
solitary candle guttered in the socket before going out,
that our party became aware of the lateness of the
hour.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we have been profitably spending the evening,
I must say," remarked Captain Campbell, rising, with a
laugh.  "You should have been in bed an hour ago,
Sibyl.  Here!  Aunt Moll," he cried, going to the door,
"bring us lights, and show Mr. Drummond to his room."
</p>

<p>
He waited for a response, but none came, only the echo
of his own voice sounded dolefully through the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  Aunt Moll, I say&mdash;Lem, bring candles," once
more called Captain Campbell.  Again he waited for an
answer, and again none came.  "Confound it!" he muttered,
turning away, "the sleepy-headed pair have doubtless
been in bed for the last three hours, and are as sound
as the Seven Sleepers by this time."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Guy," said Sibyl, laughing at his rueful
face, "I'll go.  Aunt Moll and Lem are tired, doubtless,
with their extraordinary exertions this evening, and it
would be a pity to wake them."
</p>

<p>
She quitted the room as she spoke, in the direction of
the kitchen, in search of lights.
</p>

<p>
And presently she reappeared, and announcing that
Aunt Moll was stretched out on her pallet, before the
kitchen fire, asleep, she took her light, and bidding them
a smiling good-night, left them to seek her own room.
</p>

<p>
And Captain Campbell, taking a candle, preceded his
guest in the direction of the "haunted chamber."
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond entered, and looked round.  It
was a high, wide, spacious chamber, as were all in the
house, with floors, doors, and casements of dark, polished
oak, black now with time and use.  In the wide fire-place
at one end, a fire had been burning all the evening, but
only the red, smouldering embers remained now.  At the
other end of the room, opposite the fire, was his bed, and
between them, facing the door, was a deep dormer window.
The room looked cheerful and pleasant, and throwing
himself into an easy, old-fashioned arm-chair before the
fire, he exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Well, in spite of all the ghosts and hobgoblins that
ever walked at 'noon of night,' I shall sleep here as
sound as a top until morning.  Your ghost will have to
give me a pretty vigorous shaking before I awake, when
once I close my eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps the ghost, if in the least timorous, will not
appear to so undaunted an individual as yourself.  May
your dreams be undisturbed!  Good-night!"  And placing
the light on the table Captain Campbell left the room.
</p>

<p>
Willard's first care was to lock the door securely, and
then carefully examine the room.  There was no other
means of ingress but the one by which he had entered, and
the room did not seem to communicate with any other.
The window was high above the ground, and firmly nailed
down.  Clearly, then, if the ghost entered at all it must
assume its ghostly prerogative of coming through the
keyhole&mdash;for there was no other means by which ghost or
mortal could get in.
</p>

<p>
Satisfied with this, Willard Drummond went to bed,
but in spite of all his efforts sleep would not come.  Vain
were all his attempts to woo the drowsy god; he could
only toss restlessly from side to side, with that feeling of
irritation which want of sleep produces.
</p>

<p>
The moonlight streaming in through the window filled
the room with silvery radiance.  The silence of death
reigned around, unbroken even by the watch-dog's bark.
The dull, heavy roar of the waves, breaking on the shore
like far-off thunder, was the only sound to be heard.  And
at last, with this eerie, ghostly lullaby, Willard
Drummond fell into a feverish sleep.
</p>

<p>
And sleeping, he dreamed.  He was in a comfortably
furnished home, and was recovering from a serious illness.
Just well enough to be up, he sat in a chair made
comfortable for his back by pillows.  He had been reading,
and, as he saw Sibyl enter the room in a neat-fitting
white-merino morning-robe, he let his book fall to the floor,
while she dropped on her knees beside him, and, with loving
anxiety beaming from her brilliant eyes, glanced into
his face.
</p>

<p>
Then the scene abruptly changed, and he seemed wandering
on the verge of a precipice, treading a path so narrow
and precarious that a single false step would hurl him
to certain destruction down the unfathomable gulf below.
Where that path was to end he knew not, but a white
robed siren, with shining golden hair and smiling eyes
and lips, went before him and lured him on.  An inward
voice seemed whispering him to beware, that the path he
was treading must end in death; but the smiling eyes of
the golden-haired tempter were beaming upon him, and
the voice whispered in vain.  Above every steep crag, as
he passed, the wild black eyes of Sibyl seemed gleaming
with deadly hatred and fierce malignity on him; but even
those dark, warning eyes could not tempt him back from
the road he was treading.  Suddenly the siren vanished;
he sprang after her, and fell down, down, down into the
awful gulf below.
</p>

<p>
A wild laugh rang out on the air, and Sibyl was bending
above him, holding a glittering dagger to his heart,
while her great black eyes burned like two flames.  He
held out his hands for mercy, but she only mocked him
with her deriding black eyes, and raised the knife to
plunge it into his heart.
</p>

<p>
With a cry of terror he awoke to find it not all a dream.
</p>

<p>
An icy cold hand lay on his face.
</p>

<p>
He sprang up in bed with a thrill of horror, to behold
a white, wild face, with vacant, unearthly eyes and long,
streaming hair bending over him.
</p>

<p>
Paralyzed by the sudden apparition, he sat, unable to
move or speak, and ere he could fully recover his senses
the ghostly visitant was gone.
</p>

<p>
He sprang out of bed and seized the door.  It was
locked as he had left it, and, with his blood curdling, he
stood rooted to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Morally and physically Willard Drummond was brave,
but this midnight visit from a supernatural being might
have chilled the blood of the most undaunted.  Sleep
now was out of the question; therefore, seating himself
by the window, he prepared to wait for the approach of
morning.  The moon was already sinking behind the
western horizon, bathing the placid river in its soft beams.
The morning star shone bright and serene in the cloudless
blue sky; and, gazing on the calm beauty without, the
young man's pulse ceased its feverish throbbings, and he
began striving to account for this ghostly visit by natural
means.
</p>

<p>
But he strove in vain.  The door was firmly locked,
and there could be no secret passage through those strong,
oaken walls.  Then he arose, and carefully searched every
crevice in the room that could by any possibility be made
a hiding-place of.  Still in vain.  The room contained no
living thing but himself.
</p>

<p>
Morning was now growing red in the east, and, exhausted
with watching, he threw himself on the bed, and
fell into a deep dreamless sleep, from which he did not
awake until the sun was high in the heavens.
</p>

<p>
He sprang hastily out of bed, and proceeded to dress
himself.  And now a new difficulty arose.  He felt he
would be questioned about the supernatural visitors of the
haunted chamber, and he was at a loss how to answer.  If
he related the event of the night, he dreaded the ridicule of
the unbelieving Captain Campbell, who would assuredly
laugh at him for being conquered in spite of his boasting;
and to be laughed at in the presence of Sibyl was not to
be endured.  If, on the other hand he did not tell, he
would be obliged to continue the occupant of the haunted
chamber while he remained on the island&mdash;a thing he had
not the slightest wish to do.
</p>

<p>
His toilet was finished before he could come to any
conclusion; and still debating the case, he descended the
stairs, and entered the sitting-room they had occupied the
night before.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
THE MIDNIGHT CRY.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "And when the midnight hour is come,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound is heard in yonder hall&mdash;<br>
  It rises hoarsely through the sky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vibrates o'er the moldering wall."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In a former chapter, we left Mrs. Tom in rather an
appalling situation.
</p>

<p>
Accustomed to the quiet unexciting life of the lonely,
sea-girt island, the events of the night had momentarily
terrified her, albeit her nerves were none of the weakest.  The
mysterious revelation of the dying man; his tale of
night, and storm, and crime; the wild, ghostly face at the
window; and, lastly, his sudden death, were quite enough
to thrill for an instant with terror even a stronger heart
than that of the solitary old widow.
</p>

<p>
For some moments Mrs. Tom sat still, gazing alternately
at the window and on the ghastly face of the dead
man before her, with a chill of horror creeping over her.
</p>

<p>
The sudden striking of the clock, as it chimed the hour
of eleven, aroused her at last from her trance of terror.
It was a sound of life, and it reassured her.
</p>

<p>
Rising, she gathered courage to approach the window
cautiously, and looked out.  Nothing was to be seen but
the bright moonlight, bathing rock and river in its silvery
light.  Beyond, she could see the huge, black pile of
Campbell's Castle, casting its long, gloomy shadow over
the ground.  Lights were still twinkling in the
windows&mdash;a sight as unusual as it was pleasant&mdash;and, with renewed
confidence at this sign of life, Mrs. Tom went to arouse
Carl to assist her to watch beside the dead.
</p>

<p>
"It's onpossible to sleep with a corpse in the house,"
thought Mrs. Tom, as she climbed up the ladder leading
to Carl's lofty dormitory; "leastways, I couldn't sleep a
wink, though I do s'pose that there lazy, sleepy-head of
a Carl could snore away jest as soundly as ef we was all
dead in a heap.  I reckon I'll hev an hour's work getting
him up.  Here, you Carl!  Carl!  Get up, I tell you!"
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Tom shook him lustily.  The sleeper only
replied by turning over with a grunt.
</p>

<p>
"Carl!  Carl!  Lor' sakes! you great, sleepy,
good-for-nothing, open your eyes.  I do b'lieve the last
Judgment wouldn't wake you, once you got a-snorin'.  Ef
nothin' else won't do, I'll try how you'll like this!"
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Tom caught the unfortunate Carl by the
hair and pulled it vigorously, until that ill-used youth
sprang upright, with a roar that might have been heard
half a mile off.
</p>

<p>
"Thunder and lightning, aunty, do you want to kill a
feller?" roared Master Carl, in a rage.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Carl!  Don't get mad, honey," said Mrs. Tom,
soothingly.  "I only want you to come down stairs and
set up with me.  That there sick man's dead."
</p>

<p>
"Dead!" repeated Carl, staring with all his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he's dead as can be; and it's the most lonesomest
thing in the world settin' up alone with a corpse, so I
waked you up."
</p>

<p>
"Well don't sit up with him, then," said Carl, with a
tremendous yawn.  "If he's dead, he won't mind staying
alone all night, I suppose.  Anyhow, I know I ain't going
to get up this time of night, if he was dead twice over."
</p>

<p>
And Carl lay down, and composed himself for another nap.
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Tom was resolved not to be disobeyed; so,
dropping the pacific tone she had first adopted, she very
summarily snatched away sheets and quilts, pulled the
mattress from under him, and overset poor Carl on the
floor, from which she soon made him spring up with a
sound box on the ear.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," said the indignant old lady; "tell me
ag'in you won't, will ye?  Now, look here, ef you ain't
dressed and down stairs in five minutes, I'll come back,
and this ain't no circumstance to what you'll get.  Tell
me you won't, indeed!  There's no tellin' what the
impidence of these scape-goats of boys 'ill come to, ef they
ain't minded in time," muttered the old lady to herself, as
she descended the ladder.
</p>

<p>
Carl's toilet, thus unpleasantly hastened, was soon
complete, and he descended to the lower room with a
very sulky face, and grumbling inwardly at his hard fate
in being governed by so tyrannical a task-mistress:
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why the old feller couldn't have died
somewhere else," inwardly muttered the ill-treated
Mr. Henley; "a coming here and giving bother, keeping a
feller from his sleep of nights.  It's downright mean!"
</p>

<p>
Taking possession of Mrs. Tom's rocking-chair, while
the old lady bustled about, laying out the corpse as best
she could under the circumstances, Carl was once more
soon sound asleep.  Then, when all she could do was
done, Mrs. Tom lay down on the hard wooden sofa, or
"settee," as she called it, and, in spite of the presence of
death, followed her worthy nephew to the land of dreams.
</p>

<p>
Morning was far advanced before either awoke.  Mrs. Tom's
first care was to send Carl up to the lodge to
inform its inmates of the death of her guest, and desire
Captain Campbell's immediate presence.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after breakfast the young captain hastened
to the cottage, while Sibyl and Drummond went out for a
stroll round the island.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom had been anxiously revolving in her mind
the singular story told her the night before, and resolved
to reveal it to Captain Campbell and learn his opinion
about it.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, when he entered, Mrs. Tom&mdash;having first
taken the precaution of turning Carl out of doors&mdash;related
the story in substance as it had been told to her.
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell listened in astonishment and in
credulity.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Master Guy, what do you think of that?"
exclaimed Mrs. Tom, when she had finished.
</p>

<p>
"My dear madam," replied the young man, gravely,
"the man, excited, half crazed, delirious as he was, must
have imagined all this.  No such horrible thing could
have ever occurred in a Christian land."
</p>

<p>
"But he wasn't crazy," asserted Mrs. Tom, almost
angry at having the truth of the story doubted.  "He was
just as sensible, all through, as you or I.  He wasn't
<i>colirious</i> a mite."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mrs. Tom, it's not possible that, with all your
good sense, you can credit such an incredible tale."
</p>

<p>
"But, Master Guy, the man told it on his death-bed.
Think o' that."
</p>

<p>
"And doubtless believed it, too; but that does not
make it any more probable.  I have heard of such cases
before.  It is all owing to the imagination, my dear lady.
He had fancied this story, and thought about it so long,
that he at last believed it himself."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know nothin' 'bout the 'magination,
thank my heavenly Master," said Mrs. Tom, in a sort of
sullen unbelief; "but I do know, ef you was to talk till
this time to-morrow, you couldn't make me believe
differently.  I shouldn't wonder now ef you tried to make me
think the face I seed stuck at the winder was all
'magination, too."
</p>

<p>
"I was just about to say so," said Guy, repressing a
smile.  "It could be nothing else, you know.  The hour
of night, the thrilling tale, and the man's dying cry that
he saw her there, would have made you imagine anything;
therefore&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Tom's wrath was rising.  She had been
inwardly priding herself on the sensation her story would
create, and this fall to her hopes was more than she could
patiently endure.
</p>

<p>
"It's no sich thing," she cried, in a voice louder and
sharper than she was in the habit of using to any one but
the unfortunate Carl.  "I seen it all with my two blessed
eyes, and nobody's goin' to make me believe it was my
'magination.  'Magination, indeed!" continued the old
lady, in a tone of profound contempt.  "Thank my divine
Master, I never was troubled with 'magination since the
day I was born, and 'tain't likely I'd begin now in my
old age o' life.  I allers hid a great respect for you,
Master Guy; but I'm a poor, lone 'ooman, and can't stand to
be onsulted by nobody.  I hain't no doubt you mean well,
but I like to hev people b'lieve me when I do tell the
truth.  Scat, you hussy! afore I twist your neck for you."
</p>

<p>
The latter part of this oration was addressed to Trot,
the mottled cat, and was accompanied by a kick, which
ejected that unoffending member of society out of doors,
much quicker than was at all agreeable.  Captain
Campbell, quite unprepared for this burst of eloquence,
listened in amazement, and seized the first opportunity, when
angry Mrs. Tom paused for breath, to humbly apologize
for his offense.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Mrs. Tom," said the young captain, humbly,
"I had not the remotest intention of offending you, and
most deeply regret having done so.  I have fallen into a
bad habit, of late, of doubting everything; and really this
story appeared so improbable, that I think I may be
pardoned for not yielding it full credit on the spot.  Come,
now, my dear madam," he continued, seeing the cloud
still hanging on Mrs. Tom's honest face, "let's be friends
still; and I promise for the future to believe everything
you choose to tell me, no matter what it is."
</p>

<p>
Good Mrs. Tom was not proof against the insinuating
tone of Master Guy, who had always been her favorite;
so the cloud disappeared, and her own cheery smile once
more beamed forth.
</p>

<p>
Having arranged that Lem should come down and prepare
a grave during the morning, Captain Campbell left
the cottage, and went in search of Mr. Drummond and
his sister to tell them what he had heard.
</p>

<p>
He found them down on the shore.  Sibyl stood on a
high cliff, her dress fluttering in the morning breeze, her
hat off, and her long, glittering, jetty tresses waving
behind her like a banner.  The wind that came sweeping
across the waters had deepened the glow on her crimson
cheeks and lips, and sent a living light into her glorious
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond stood beneath, gazing at her as a
poet might gaze on the living realization of his most
beautiful dreams.  Captain Campbell shrugged his shoulders
expressively as he saw his impassioned glance, and
thought inwardly of the confession he had once made to
him of there being but one woman in the world worth
loving.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Sibyl, one would think you were attitudinizing
for the stage," said Captain Campbell, dryly, as he
approached.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl laughed gayly, as she sprang down on the white,
level sands between her brother and lover.
</p>

<p>
"I was only looking out for a sail, which I failed to
discover," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Campbell," said Drummond, "had your old
lady down below any important revelations to make, that
she sent for you in such haste this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Not very important in my eyes, though they are in
hers," replied the young captain.  "She wished to reveal
the dying deposition of our passenger, Richard Grove."
</p>

<p>
"And what had he to tell?  Was I right in saying
remorse for some crime preyed on him more than mere
illness?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith, Sibyl, according to worthy Mrs. Tom, I believe
you were.  He succeeded in frightening that good, but
slightly credulous old lady out of her wits."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Sibyl, inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell, condensing the story, gave them
the outline and principal facts in a few words.  Both
listened with deep interest; but when he spoke of the pale,
haggard face, with its dark, waving hair, glaring at them
through the window, Willard Drummond started violently,
and turned pale.  Sibyl's eagle eyes were fixed on his face,
and she alone observed it.
</p>

<p>
"And what does Mrs. Tom take this nocturnal visitor
to be?" inquired Sibyl.  "A mortal like herself, or a
spirit disembodied?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a ghost, of course," replied her brother.  "The
spirit, perhaps, of the woman walled up to perish in the
room with the murdered man.  Ugh! the story altogether
is hideous enough to give one the nightmare!  And now
that you have learned all, I believe I'll go and send Lem
down to inter the body."
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell sauntered away, and the lovers were
alone.
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think of this story, Willard?"
inquired Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell.  Yesterday I would have joined your
brother in laughing at it; but, to-day&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused.
</p>

<p>
"And why not to-day?" breathlessly inquired Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, I do not wish to needlessly alarm you, but last
night, as if to punish my presumption, I experienced
something very like a supernatural visit."
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens, Willard!  Then the story told by the
negroes is true?"
</p>

<p>
"It certainly seems like it.  Had any one else told me
what I experienced, I should think they were humbugging
me; but I cannot discredit what I saw with my own
eyes."
</p>

<p>
"And what was the appearance of the nocturnal visitor?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly like the description Mrs. Tom gives of the
face that appeared at her window&mdash;white as that of the
dead, with dark, streaming hair, and wild, vacant, dark
eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard!  Can it be that&mdash;&mdash;  But, no; it is
impossible.  At what hour did this apparition appear?"
</p>

<p>
"Between one and two, as near as I can judge."
</p>

<p>
"Strange! strange!  I, too, heard something dreadful
last night."
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible?  What was it, dearest Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
"Listen!  About midnight I was awakened by something
that sounded like a heavy fall right outside my
door, followed by a groan so deep, so horrible, that the
very blood seemed freezing in my veins.  Trembling with
terror, I half rose to listen; but all for a time was still.
Trying to persuade myself I was only dreaming, I was
about to lie down again, when a shriek the most appalling
broke upon the air, and died away in an agonized
moan.  I dared not move; I could not sleep; and I lay
cowering in superstitious horror until morning.  With
the bright sunshine came renewed courage, and I feared
to mention what I had heard to my brother or you, lest
I should be laughed at&mdash;even as you feared the same.
Willard, there must be some horrible mystery here!
Some foul crime, I fear, has at some time been
perpetrated within those walls.  What if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She paused.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Sibyl?" he said, inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! what if <i>this</i> house has been the scene
of that mystery the dying man spoke of!  I thought of
it from the first."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Sibyl!  What an idea!"  And yet he
looked disturbed himself, as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"How otherwise are we to account for those ghostly
visitings, those midnight apparitions, and appalling
shrieks?"
</p>

<p>
"And yet nothing could induce your brother to adopt
your belief.  He would laugh at our credulity, were we
to tell him what we have seen and heard."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and, perhaps I had better not tell him, Willard.
I will have your room changed, and my own likewise.
Even if they are less comfortable, they will be more
endurable than to be disturbed by midnight specters."
</p>

<p>
"Be it so, then, fairest Sibyl," he said, gayly.  And
turning, they walked together to the Lodge.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
"OFF WITH THE OLD LOVE, AND ON WITH THE NEW."
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Holy St. Francis! what a change is here!<br>
  Is Rosalind, whom thou didst love so dear,<br>
  So soon forsaken?  Young men's love, then, lies<br>
  Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes."&mdash;ROMEO AND JULIET.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The following night passed without disturbance,
either earthly or ghostly, at Campbell's Lodge.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning, Captain Campbell went
over to the mainland on business.  And Sibyl, accompanied
by Drummond, went down to the cottage, to visit
Mrs. Tom.  There was an inward feeling of pleasure at
Sibyl's heart, when she learned Christie was away to the
mainland on a visit.  Not that she doubted Willard; but
she remembered Christie as a very pretty child, grown by
this time, doubtless, into a lovely girl, and it might not be
altogether safe, to throw the gay man of the world into
dangerous society.
</p>

<p>
Toward noon, as they were sauntering along the sun-shiny
beach, she hanging on his arm, while he softly whispered
the words "ladies love to hear," they espied a boat
advancing toward them.  Sibyl raised her telescope to
survey the new-comers.
</p>

<p>
"Rev. Mr. Mark Brantwell and wife," she exclaimed,
in tones of surprise and pleasure.  "Guy has doubtless
called upon them, and told them I was here."
</p>

<p>
"Friends of yours?" asked Willard.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the Episcopal clergyman of N&mdash;&mdash;, whom I have
known since my earliest childhood.  But here they are."
</p>

<p>
The boat at this moment touched the shore, and Sibyl,
disengaging her arm, ran down to meet them.  Willard
more leisurely followed, just in time to see his lady-love
folded in the arms of a gentleman who sprang from the
boat.
</p>

<p>
The stranger was of middle age, married, and a clergyman;
yet, in spite of all, Mr. Drummond felt a sudden
twinge of jealousy and anger at beholding the embrace.
But the next moment jealousy, anger, every feeling was
swallowed up in intense astonishment, not unmingled
with superstitious horror.  For as the clergyman turned
round, and Willard obtained a full view of his face, he
recognized the countenance of him he had seen years
before in that mystic vision at the Egyptian's.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he stood regarding him, pale with wonder;
and he only awoke from his trance of surprise, when
he heard the clear, ringing voice of Captain Campbell, as
he approached him, saying, with a hearty slap on the
shoulder:
</p>

<p>
"Why, Drummond, man alive, what ails you?  You are
as pale as a ghost!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you ill?" said Sibyl, anxiously, as she
approached, leaning on the arm of Mrs. Brantwell.
</p>

<p>
"A slight headache&mdash;nothing more," said Willard,
recovering himself by an effort; "nothing worth being
alarmed about," he added, seeing Sibyl's still anxious
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Sibyl, have you grown nervous and cowardly?"
exclaimed Mr. Brantwell&mdash;"you, who used to be as bold
and daring as a mountain eaglet.  But perhaps," he added,
glancing meaningly at Willard, "it is only where some
very particular friend is concerned that your fears are
thus easily aroused."
</p>

<p>
Willard smiled slightly, while Sibyl's dark face grew
crimson as she hurried on with increased rapidity,
drawing her companion with her, and leaving the gentlemen
behind.
</p>

<p>
When they reached the lodge Sibyl left her brother to
entertain their guests, while she set about preparing
luncheon.  When the meal was over Mrs. Brantwell said:
</p>

<p>
"And now, Miss Sibyl, I have come to carry you off.
It is three years since I have had the pleasure of seeing
you, and I shall certainly take you with me now.  Come,
no excuses&mdash;I will not hear one of them."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear Mrs. Brantwell&mdash;&mdash;" began Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear Miss Campbell, you <i>must</i> come&mdash;do you
hear that?  Your brother can certainly do without you for
a week."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and glad to be rid of her, too," said the gallant
Captain Campbell.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl stole a glance toward Drummond from under
her long eyelashes.  He was sitting, looking out of the
window with an exceedingly dissatisfied frown on his
brow.  Mrs. Brantwell perceived the glance, and broke
out again with her usual bluntness:
</p>

<p>
"And as for that other gentleman you are looking at,
Sibyl, I am sure he will be generous enough to spare you
for a few days, as he will, in all probability, have enough
of you before long."
</p>

<p>
Again Sibyl crimsoned and glanced reproachfully at
her plain-spoken friend, and again Mr. Drummond was
forced to smile, in spite of his ill-humor, at the good
lady's brusque bluntness.
</p>

<p>
"You will have to come, you see, Miss Sibyl," said
Mr. Brantwell, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, she will," added his frank spouse; "and
upon my word I think I am doing her a favor in taking
her from this lonesome island, and letting her see a little
of civilized life at our hands; though, from Sibyl's looks,
I should say she doesn't feel at all grateful for it."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Mrs. Brantwell, I do, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There, there!  I won't listen to another word."  And
Mrs. Brantwell, a tall, good-humored looking lady,
clapped her hands over her ears.  "Guy, make this ungrateful
sister of yours hold her tongue, and do as she is told."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Sibyl, there is no help for it, you see," said
Guy.  "Drummond and I will get along swimmingly
during your absence.  He can keep his hand in, in
making love to Aunt Moll, while I try my powers of
persuasion over Mrs. Tom."
</p>

<p>
Sibyl laughed, and paused for a moment in thought.
She would infinitely have preferred remaining on the
island with Willard, but it would never do to allow them
to think that was her reason; and after all, a week would
soon pass.  Had Christie been home, no persuasions could
have induced her to go; but in her absence there was
nothing to fear.  Then, too, Willard, so long accustomed
to her presence, would miss her so much when she was
gone that doubtless his love would be increased rather
than diminished.
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily, while thinking of him, her eyes
wandered to where he stood.  Again the sharp-sighted
Mrs. Brantwell observed it, and again she broke out
impatiently:
</p>

<p>
"Lord bless me!  Mr. Drummond, just turn round,
will you, and tell Sibyl she may go.  Nothing earthly will
induce her to come till you give permission.  I'm sure if
you were her father she couldn't be more afraid of
displeasing your lordship."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Campbell needs no permission of mine.  I am
only too happy to think she will have an opportunity of
enjoying herself so well," said Willard, with a grave bow.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm sure that's a mercy to be thankful for.
Now, perhaps, you will come, Sibyl," said the plain-spoken
old lady; "and as for you, sir, I shall expect to
see you at the parsonage every day with Master Guy."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be most happy," said Willard, his face brightening
a little, while Sibyl's eyes sparkled with anticipation.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now, run and get ready," said Mrs. Brantwell,
turning to Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl soon reappeared, dressed for her journey.  And
then, as the afternoon was far advanced, the whole party
descended to the beach.  The adieus were spoken, the
boat pushed off, leaving the two young men alone on the
sands.
</p>

<p>
"I must go over to Westbrook dock-yard this afternoon,"
said Guy, "where the Evening Star is now lying.
What do you say to coming with me?"
</p>

<p>
"I prefer remaining here," said Willard, who had not
yet recovered his good humor, after what he was pleased
to call Sibyl's desertion.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I'll remain with you," said Guy, who was
the soul of frankness and good temper.
</p>

<p>
"By no means!" said Drummond, hastily.  "Do not
stay on my account.  I have a slight headache still, and
will retire to my room."
</p>

<p>
"But it seems hardly courteous to leave you altogether
alone."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, my dear fellow.  I insist upon it.  I hope
you do not think of standing on ceremony with me?"
</p>

<p>
"So be it, then," said Captain Campbell, gayly, as he
sprang into his boat, pushed off, and shot like an arrow
out into the water.
</p>

<p>
Drawing a cigar from his pocket, Willard Drummond
lit it and proceeded to stroll up and down the beach, in
no very amiable frame of mind.  He felt angry, in spite
of all, at Sibyl's leaving him; and with this feeling would
now and then mingle another&mdash;profound amazement at
the exact resemblance this Mr. Brantwell bore to the face
he had seen in that singular vision.  Was the fell
prediction about to be verified?
</p>

<p>
Lost in such thoughts as these, he was suddenly startled
by a voice singing a wild, sweet song of the sea, in
the clearest and most delightful tones he had ever heard.
Surprised at the unexpected sound, he sprang up the
rocks in the direction whence it came, and beheld a sight
that transfixed him with amazement.
</p>

<p>
A young girl, beautiful as an angel, stood on an
overhanging crag, with one round, white arm resting lightly
on the rocks, singing to herself as she gazed on the
sparkling waters.  Her hair, of the palest golden hue,
rose and fell in the breeze, and flashed in the sunlight
that rested like a glory on her bright young head.  Her
complexion was dazzlingly fair, with rose-tinted cheeks
and full, red lips&mdash;like wet coral&mdash;and eyes large and
bright, and blue as the summer sky above her.  Her
figure was slight, but round and voluptuous; and there was
passion, and fervor, and wild enthusiasm in her look, as
she stood like a stray seraph, dropped from some stray
cloud, on that lonely island.
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond stood immovable, drinking in, to
intoxication, the bewildering draught of her beauty.  She
was in every respect so very different from Sibyl, that
she seemed to him the more charming from force of contrast.
Transfixed he stood&mdash;everything forgotten but this
lovely creature before him&mdash;when suddenly, like an
inspiration, came the remembrance of his singular dream, and
of the fatal siren with the golden hair.  Strange that it
should have come back to him so vividly and painfully
then!
</p>

<p>
The young girl's song ceased, and turning, she leaped
lightly as a young deer from her fairy perch, without
perceiving him who stood so intently regarding her.
Leaping from rock to rock with a fleetness that awoke the
surprise of Willard, she reached the road and disappeared
within she cottage of Mrs. Tom.
</p>

<p>
Everything was forgotten now but the one intense
desire of knowing who this radiant sea-nymph was.
Turning, therefore, into the path she had just taken, he
approached the cottage and encountered Carl at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Master Henley, how are you?" said Willard,
carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Sticking together," was Master Henly's concise and
descriptive answer.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to hear it," said Willard, repressing a strong
inclination to laugh.  "Is Mrs. Tom within?"
</p>

<p>
"She was when I left the house," said Carl, who
seemed determined not to commit himself.
</p>

<p>
"Any one with her?" again inquired the young
gentleman, looking as indifferent as possible.
</p>

<p>
"No, nobody," was the unexpected answer.
</p>

<p>
"What!" exclaimed Willard, surprised.  "I thought I
saw a young lady enter a moment ago!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Christie&mdash;she's nobody," said the gallant
Mr. Henly.
</p>

<p>
"Christie&mdash;Mrs. Tom's niece&mdash;I thought she was
away!" exclaimed Willard.
</p>

<p>
"So she was, but I went for her this morning; couldn't
be bothered doing her work and my own both any
longer," said Carl.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I may go in?" said Willard, feeling a sudden
thrill of pleasure at the knowledge that this radiant
girl was an inhabitant of the island.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose you may, if you like," said Carl, in a
tone of the utmost unconcern.
</p>

<p>
Thus kindly permitted, Willard advanced and rapped
at the door.  It was opened by Mrs. Tom, whose surprise
was only equaled by her delight at being honored by this
unexpected visit.
</p>

<p>
Near the window that overlooked the lodge, stood the
golden-haired vision of the beach.  She turned round
with a quick, shy glance, and blushed most enchantingly
beneath the deep, dark eyes of the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"My niece, Christie, Mr. Drummond," said Mrs. Tom,
directing his attention to her with a wave of her hand.
"She got back this mornin'.  I allers find it powerful
lonesome here without Christie."
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt of it," said Mr. Drummond, seating
himself.  "But I have had the pleasure of seeing Miss
Christie before."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" asked Christie, opening her blue eyes in
wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Down on the beach, a few moments ago."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes."
</p>

<p>
And again Christie blushed vividly, as she recollected
how she had been caught singing.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Miss Sibyl and Master Guy?" inquired Mrs. Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl has gone to N&mdash;&mdash; with the clergyman's
family, and will not return for a week; and Captain
Campbell has gone to Westbrook, where his vessel is
undergoing repairs.  So I am left all alone, and came to
pay my respects to you."
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll stay and spend the evenin'?" said Mrs. Tom,
smiling complacently.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Drummond professed his willingness; and the
little widow, delighted at the condescension, set about
preparing tea instantly, assisted by Christie, whose wild,
shy glances were bent on his face whenever she fancied
herself unobserved.  Half pleased, half afraid of him at
first, she was reserved and timid; but as this wore off,
he drew her into conversation, and, to his surprise, found
her intelligent and well-educated.  This Mrs. Tom
accounted for, by saying she had gone to school for the
last five years at Westbrook, residing there with the friend
she had now been visiting.
</p>

<p>
The evening passed away with the rapidity of magic.
Christie, after much solicitation, consented to sing for
him; and if anything was needed to fairly enchant him,
that sweet, clear voice would have done it.  Then, too,
Carl added to the general hilarity, by drawing out a rusty
Jew's-harp, and playing a favorite tune of his own
composition.  Not once during the evening did he think of
Sibyl; her dark, resplendant face, and wild fierce, black
eyes, were forgotten for the golden locks and sweet, fair
face of blue-eyed Christie&mdash;this dainty island Peri.
</p>

<p>
The hour for leaving came all too soon.  As he reluctantly
rose to go, he pressed the hand Christie extended,
to his lips, with such passionate ardor that the blood
flushed to her very temples, but not with pleasure.  Ere
he left, Mrs. Tom cordially invited him to visit her house
while he remained on the island&mdash;an invitation he was not
loth in accepting.
</p>

<p>
Christie stood at the window, watching his tall,
elegant form as he walked toward the castle in the bright,
clear moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"I like him, Cousin Christie; don't you?" said Carl,
when he had gone.
</p>

<p>
But Cousin Christie turned away without reply, longing
to lay her burning cheek on the pillow, and muse
over the new and delicious joy that was thrilling her
whole heart, and in her slumber to lie dreaming "Love's
young dream."
</p>

<p>
And Willard Drummond, forgetting his vows, forgetting
Sibyl, forgetting honor, forgetting all but this lovely
island-maiden, sought his couch with but one name on
his heart and lips&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Christie, Christie!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
THE HEART'S STRUGGLE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "She loves, but knows not whom she loves,<br>
  Nor what his race, nor whence he came;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one who meets in Indian groves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some beauteous bird without a name,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought by the last ambrosial breeze<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show his plumage for a day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wondering eyes, then wing away."&mdash;LALLA ROOKH.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Pale, feverish, and unrefreshed, after a night of
restless dreams, Willard Drummond arose from a vision
of Christie to hail a new day.
</p>

<p>
Passion and principle were at war already.  Bound by
every pledge of love, by every vow, to Sibyl, his whole
soul was steeped in this new, all-absorbing passion that
had taken possession of him.  He had fancied he loved
her, until he beheld radiant, dazzling, bewildering Christie
and from that moment he could have yielded heaven for
her.  Every feeling of his inmost heart and soul was up,
in arms.  Every feeling of honor bade him fly from this
intoxicating siren, whose power he felt growing stronger
each moment over him; but the voice of passion cried:
"Remain! love her, if you will!  What right has Sibyl
to stand between you and the heaven of your dreams?"  And,
like all who allow the struggle between right and
wrong to wage its warfare in their bosom, Willard
Drummond was lost.  For, with his hot, fervid, Southern
nature, worldly considerations, former vows, reason,
principle, justice, even honor, were swept away, like a wall
of smoke, before the fierce impetuosity of passion.
</p>

<p>
With a head throbbing, and pulse quick and feverish
with the inward conflict, Willard descended to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell stood in the sitting-room, awaiting
his coming.  With a courteous "good morning," he
advanced to meet him; but started back in surprise at
beholding his extreme pallor.
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow," he exclaimed, in a tone of solicitude,
"you are ill&mdash;very ill, I am afraid.  What in the
world is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  I had bad dreams, and did not sleep well,"
said Drummond, with a forced smile.  "A cup of Aunt
Moll's excellent coffee will set me all right again."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that," said Captain Campbell, with
his eyes fixed anxiously on his face, "You are looking
terribly feverish, and you were complaining of a
headache yesterday.  I hope you are not going to be ill."
</p>

<p>
"I assure you it is nothing," said Willard, in a tone of
slight impatience.  "You are needlessly alarming
yourself.  A bad night's rest is the cause of all."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if it is not, I will have to call up Mrs. Tom to
nurse you till Sibyl comes.  And, by the way, I regret
exceedingly that I shall be obliged to leave you solitary
and alone for some days.  Important business, that cannot
be postponed, demands my immediate attention."
</p>

<p>
Willard's heart suddenly bounded&mdash;he would scarcely
have acknowledged to himself the reason&mdash;at the words.
</p>

<p>
"It seems hardly courteous or hospitable to leave you
thus," continued the young captain; "but I know you
will excuse me, my dear fellow, when I tell you it cannot
possibly be helped."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly, certainly!" interrupted Drummond,
cordially.  "Go, by all means.  I will get along well
enough in your absence.  When do you leave?"
</p>

<p>
"Immediately after breakfast.  It is an affair that
cannot be postponed.  In fact, I will not have time even to
go and see Sibyl; but, as you will probably be there
during the day, you can tell her.  Perhaps you will come
over to the mainland with me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I think not," said Willard, with affected carelessness.
"I may go during the course of the day."
</p>

<p>
"But how?  I will take the boat."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, with Carl Henly.  He has one, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Well, suit yourself.  And now I'm off.  Take care
of yourself, my boy; and <i>au revoir</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Good-by!" said Willard, accompanying him to the
door.  "Aunt Moll and I will keep bachelor's hall till
you come back."
</p>

<p>
Captain Guy laughed, and hurried down to the
beach.  And when he was gone, Willard arranged his
slightly disordered dress and disheveled locks, and
sauntering out, almost mechanically took the road to the
cottage.
</p>

<p>
It came in sight at last&mdash;this little, quaint, old house,
that held all of heaven to him now.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I enter&mdash;shall I thrust myself into temptation?"
was his thought.  "If I look again on this fairy sylph I
am lost!"
</p>

<p>
He thought of Sibyl, and her dark, bright, menacing
eyes arose before him, as if to warn him back.
</p>

<p>
"For your honor's sake&mdash;for your life's sake&mdash;for your
soul's sake&mdash;go not there!" said the threatening voice of
conscience.
</p>

<p>
"And have I not a right to love whom I please?  Why
should I offer violence to myself in leaving this bright
enchantress, for that dark, wild Amazon?  Go, go, and be
happy," said passion.
</p>

<p>
And, as if to overthrow his last good resolution, the
image of Christie, radiant, dazzling, and beautiful, as he
had beheld her first, in the bright flush of the fading sun
light, arose before him, and once again passion conquered.
</p>

<p>
He approached and entered the cottage.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom sat near the window, spinning and singing
to herself.  Willard's eyes wandered around in search of
another; but bright Christie was not to be seen.
</p>

<p>
The widow arose, smiling, to welcome her guest, and
placed a chair for him near herself.  And still Willard's
eyes went wandering round the room.
</p>

<p>
"She will appear presently," he thought, not yet
liking to inquire for her.
</p>

<p>
"What a venerable-looking affair your wheel is, Mrs. Tom,"
he said, surveying it, with its hard polished wood
and bright brass rings.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's as old as the hills," said Mrs. Tom, resuming
her work; "and has been in our family since the flood.
I think I spun on that there wheel all the yarn that makes
the socks, mittens, and comforters for half the county
round; besides making sheets, blankets, and lots of other
things for ourselves," said Mrs. Tom, with conscious
pride.
</p>

<p>
"You deserve a premium for industry, Mrs. Tom,"
said Willard.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you may be jokin' now, and I dare say you are;
but it is true, for all that.  Many a true word is spoke in
jest, you know," said Mrs. Tom, as her wheel went
merrily round.  "There ain't many women in this place o'
my age and means, can do, or does do more work than
me, though I say it as hadn't oughter.  I knit, and spin,
and sew, wash, brew, bake, sow, and reap, and fifty other
things, too numerous to mention, besides.  Carl, if I go
out there I'll put an end to your lazin', you idle,
good-for-nothin' vagabone, you!" she added, breaking off in
sudden wrath, as she espied Carl, leaning on the spade
with which he should have been digging in the garden.
</p>

<p>
"You should make Carl do these things, Mrs. Tom,"
said Willard, still impatiently watching the door and
wondering why Christie did not come.
</p>

<p>
"Carl?" said Mrs. Tom, with a short laugh.  "Lor'-a-massy! he
ain't worth his salt; that there's the laziest,
most worthlessest young scape-goat ever any living 'oman
was plagued with.  I hain't a minute's peace with him
night nor day; and if scolding was a mite of good, the
Lord knows he might have been a saint by this time, for
he gets enough of it."
</p>

<p>
Willard laughed.  And in such conversation the morning
slipped away&mdash;very rapidly to Mrs. Tom, but each
moment an age to our impatient lover.  For Christie was
absent still; and a strange reluctance, for which he
could not account, still prevented Willard from asking for
her.  It was an inward sense of guilt that troubled him;
for, feeling toward her as he did, he felt he had no right
even to mention her name.
</p>

<p>
At last, in despair, he arose to go.  Mrs. Tom relieved
his mind by saying:
</p>

<p>
"Christie will be disappointed at not seeing you," said
the old lady, following him out.  "She went out berrying
to the woods this morning, and hain't got home yet."
</p>

<p>
Willard started at the information; and, inwardly
cursing the folly that had detained him so many hours
talking to a foolish old woman, he darted off, with a
rapidity that quite amazed Mrs. Tom, in the direction of
the pine woods.
</p>

<p>
"What a confounded fool I have been," he exclaimed,
savagely, "to stay there listening to the way to make
butter, and flannel, and 'yarb tea,' as if the old beldame
thought I was going to be somebody's housekeeper, or a
female doctress; and all the time this enchanting little
blue-eyed witch was wandering alone by herself.  What
an opportunity I have lost! and now I suppose I may
search for an hour and not find her."
</p>

<p>
He turned an abrupt angle in the winding path, and
stifled a sudden exclamation of surprise and delight;
for there before him, reclining on the grass, with
half-veiled eyes, and soft, musing smile, sat the object of all
his thoughts, wishes, and desires.
</p>

<p>
He paused for a moment to contemplate the picture
before him, for, if Christie had seemed beautiful when
he first beheld her, oh, doubly lovely did she appear now
in her attitude of unstudied grace.
</p>

<p>
Her dress was a loose, light muslin robe, fitting to
perfection her rounded waist and swelling bust.  Her
straw hat lay on the ground beside her, and her golden,
sunshiny hair floated, with all its wealth of rippling
ringlets, round her ivory throat.  How dazzlingly fair looked
that smooth, snowy brow, contrasted with the full crimson
lips and delicately flushed cheeks&mdash;how enchanting
the long curved lashes, falling over the deep-blue eyes&mdash;how
beautiful that faultless form, that soft, gentle, happy
smile of guileless girlhood.
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond's breath came and went, quick
and short, as he gazed, and his dark eyes filled with a
subdued fire.
</p>

<p>
He advanced toward her.  His shadow, falling on the
grass at her feet, was the first token she had of his
coming.  With a quick, startled cry, she sprang to her feet
in terror; but when she saw who it was that stood before
her, she stopped short, while the color flushed gloriously
to her rounded cheeks.  Her first impression was: He
has read my thoughts in my face, and knows I was
thinking of him.
</p>

<p>
"Have I disturbed you, bright Christie?" he asked,
coming nearer.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" she answered, blushingly.  "I was only
waiting to rest a little while before going home."
</p>

<p>
"And dreaming, I perceive," said Willard.  "May I
ask, of what&mdash;of whom?"
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't dreaming," said Christie, innocently.  "I
was wide awake all the time."
</p>

<p>
"Day-dreaming, I mean," said Drummond, with a
smile.  "Do you know, fairest Christie, I have been at
your cottage all the morning, waiting to see you?"
</p>

<p>
"To see me?" said Christie, with another quick, glad
blush.
</p>

<p>
"And not finding you there, I have come in search of
you," he continued.
</p>

<p>
"And found me," she said, laughing.  "If I had
known you were coming I should have staid at home."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it is better as it is, bright one; for I have
found you alone.  It is very pleasant to have found so
fair companion on this lonely isle."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is a lonely place," said Christie, musingly;
"and yet I like it better than Westbrook, or any other
place I have ever been in.  Only I would like always to
have a friend with me to talk to; and that, you know, I
cannot have here.  Aunt Tom is always too busy to go
out; and Carl don't care about the trouble of talking,
much less walking, so I always have to go alone."
</p>

<p>
"And if he would go, I fancy Master Carl is hardly
the kind of companion Miss Christie would select," said
Willard.
</p>

<p>
"Not if I could find any better," said Christie, with a
laugh; "but I have grown so accustomed to being alone
now that I do not mind it at all, as I used to."
</p>

<p>
"And so you are perfectly happy here, fairest Christie,
reigning queen of this fairy isle?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no! beautiful Miss Sibyl is queen of the isle.  I
am only her most loyal subject," said Christie, gayly;
"you ought to know that, having paid her your
allegiance."
</p>

<p>
"What if I should say that the subject is more lovely
than the queen?" said Willard, in a low voice, and in a
tone that brought the hot blood flushing to Christie's
face.
</p>

<p>
"I should say you were laughing at me, as of course
you would be.  Certainly no one would ever think of me
while Miss Sibyl was near.  Oh! how I wish she would
always stay here, and then I would have a companion."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, bright one! if I were in her place, what would I
not surrender for such a privilege!"
</p>

<p>
"Would you?" said Christie, looking at him in
unfeigned surprise; "then why not stay?  I am sure I
should be glad to have you here always."
</p>

<p>
Her innocent words, her enticing beauty, her child-like
candor, were a strong temptation.  For one moment
he was about to fall before her, to clasp her in his arms,
to hold her there forever, while he breathed forth his mad,
passionate love, and told her nothing on earth should ever
part them now.  But again rose before him the dark,
warning face of Sibyl to allay the fever in his blood.  It
seemed to him he could see her black, fierce eyes
gleaming on them through the trees&mdash;he could almost hear her
voice shouting "Traitor!"
</p>

<p>
All unconscious of the struggle raging in his breast,
Christie stood leaning against a tree, her curved crimson
lips half parted&mdash;her blue eyes fixed on a cloud drifting
slowly over the sky, little dreaming of the far darker
clouds gathering rapidly, now, over the horizon of her
life.
</p>

<p>
And still in Willard's heart went on the struggle.  He
dared not look at her as she stood before him&mdash;-bright,
radiant, bewildering&mdash;lest the last lingering remains of
fidelity and honor should be swept away by the fierce
impetuosity of passion in his unstable heart.
</p>

<p>
But his good angel was in the ascendant still, for at
that moment the voice of Carl was heard calling loudly;
</p>

<p>
"Christie!  Christie!"
</p>

<p>
"Here, Carl!  Here I am," she answered; and in
another instant honest Carl stood before them.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Tom sent me looking for you," said the young
gentleman, rather sulkily; "and I've been tramping through
the woods this half-hour, while you were taking it easy
here," said Carl, wiping the perspiration from his brow.
</p>

<p>
"It was all my fault, my good Carl," said Willard, as
Christie hastily snatched up her hat and basket and fled,
having a just terror of Mrs. Tom's sharp tongue.  "Make
my excuses to your good aunt, and here is something for
yourself."
</p>

<p>
Carl's dull face brightened wonderfully as Willard
drew a gold piece from his pocket and pressed it into his
hand, and then turned his steps slowly in the direction of
Campbell Castle, thinking all earthly happiness lay
centered in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom's reproaches fell unheeded, for the first time,
on Christie's ear that day.  She heard not a word of the
long lecture delivered with more than the good widow's
usual eloquence, for she was thinking of another voice,
whose lowest tone had power already to thrill to the
innermost recesses of her heart.  She loved without knowing
it, without wishing to define the new, delicious feeling
filling her breast, only conscious she had never been so
happy before in her life, and longing for the time when
she should see him again.  Ah, well had it been for her
had they never met more.

<p>
"Well," said Aunt Moll, to her son and heir,
Lem, as he entered the long, high kitchen of
Campbell's Lodge, "I would like ter know
what dat ar Master Drummin's up ter?  I doesn't
understan' dese yer new-fangled young men 'tall.  Fust he
comes a courtin' of our Miss Sibyl, and jes' as soon as her
back's turned he goes rite off an' takes up wid dat ar
Miss Chrissy."
</p>

<p>
"'Tain't no business your'n, ole woman," said Lem,
gruffly.  "I 'spec's as how Marse Drummin' knows what
he's about."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, honey; but 'pears to me I ought to tell Miss
Sibyl 'bout it.  Ef he is her beau, he oughtn't to be takin'
up wid dat ar Miss Chrissy.'
</p>

<p>
"Better let Miss Sibyl look arter her own beau,"
replied her dutiful son.  "How does ye know he's a
courtin' Miss Chrissy?"
</p>

<p>
"'Cause I seed dem, chile&mdash;yes I did&mdash;las' night, down
on de shore.  De moon was shinin' jes' as bright as a new
pin, an' I took dat ar litter o' kittens down to de shore to
drown 'em, when I seed Marse Drummin' a walkin' along
wid Miss Chrissy, and he had his head stooped down jes'
so,"&mdash;and Aunt Moll ducked her woolly head to illustrate
it&mdash;"an' was whisperin' soft stuff, jes' as folks do when
dey're in love."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what den?" asked Lem, growing interested.
</p>

<p>
"Well dey come up ah' seed me, in course, an', Lor',
Lor'!  I jes' wish you seed de look Marse Drummin' give
me.  'Peared as ef he'd a liked to knocked my ole head
off.  But I warn't afeared, 'deed I warn't, chile; so I jes'
stood still an' drapped a courtesy, an' Miss Chrissy, she
got red rite up to de roots ob her hair.  'Good-evenin',
marse and young miss,' sez I; 'don't be skeered; I only
wants to drown dese little kittens,' sez I, for I thought as
I might be perlite jest as well as not.
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, how does yer do, Aunt Moll?' sez Miss Chrissy,
a laughin' an' blushin'; 'how is Lem and yer rheumatiz,
dese times?'
</p>

<p>
"'T'ank you, honey,' sez I, 'dey's pretty well, bof ob
dem.'
</p>

<p>
"An' den Marse Drummin' he pulled her arm right
troo his'n, and marched her off wid him; an' den I pitched
de kittens right in de water an' come home."
</p>

<p>
"Well, dat ar warn't much," said the skeptical Lem.
"Dey might be walkin' on de beach, but that ain't by no
means courtin'.  Marse Drummin' walk wid her, 'cause
Miss Sibyl's gone, an' he ain't got nobody else to talk to."
</p>

<p>
"'Cisely so, chile; but dat ain't all," says Aunt Moll.
"Dis berry mornin', as I was passin' troo de hall, de
sittin'-room door was open, and I heered voices a talkin'
dere; so I listened and peeked in, an' dar was Marse
Drummin', rampin' up and down, a talking to hisself."
</p>

<p>
"Well, dat ain't nothin', eider," said the still contradictory
Lem.  "I've hearn dat ar Carl talk to hisself when
Miss Tom sent him out to work; an' he ain't in love wid
no one."
</p>

<p>
"But listen, honey, and don't you be puttin' me out
so, 'cause 'tain't 'spectful&mdash;'deed it ain't," said Aunt Moll,
getting slightly indignant.  "As I was sayin', I clapt my
ear to de door, an' I heered him sayin' jes' as plain as
nothin' 'tall;
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, dischanting, onwildering Chrissy! ef I had
nebber met you, I might yet be happy!'  Dar, what he say
dat for ef he warn't in lub?"
</p>

<p>
This last was a settler.  Lem felt that his mother had
the best of the argument, and unwilling to seem defeated,
he went out, leaving the old lady to enjoy her triumph.
</p>

<p>
Three days had passed since the departure of Sibyl,
and certainly Willard's conduct seemed to justify Aunt
Moll's suspicions.  Unable to break the thrall which
bound him, wishing, yet unable to fly from the spell of
the enchantress, he lingered still by her side.  There
were shame, dishonor, sin, in remaining, but oh! there
were death, misery, and desolation in going.  All worldly
considerations, her unknown birth, her obscure
connections, her lowly rank, were swept away like walls of
cobweb before the fierce torrent of passion that
overwhelmed, conquered every other feeling in its impetuous
tide.
</p>

<p>
And she loved him, this angel of beauty, this fairy
princess of the isle; he could see it in the quick flush of
joy at his approach, the quick, burning glances shot
from her beautiful eyes, more quickly averted when they
met his&mdash;her low, impassioned tones, her bright, beautiful
blushes.  There was joy, there was rapture in the thought;
and yet, unless he forgot honor, vows, all that should
have been sacred, what did this love avail?
</p>

<p>
And so, like a tempest-tossed bark on a tempest-tossed
sea, he strove with passion and honor, love and remorse,
right and wrong.
</p>

<p>
Once only, fearing lest her suspicions might be aroused
by his absence, he had visited Sibyl, whose rapturous
greeting and confiding love made him feel far more of a
villain than ever.  He looked forward with dread to the
period of her return, fearing for the discovery of his
falsity; but, more than all, fearing for the effects of her
fierce wrath on Christie, knowing well what must be the
strength of Sibyl's passion when unchained.
</p>

<p>
And so, when Mrs. Brantwell proposed that Sibyl
should remain with her another week, instead of returning
to the dreary isle, instead of feeling irritated now, he
backed the proposal, saying that perhaps it would be better
for her to do so, more especially during her brother's
absence.
</p>

<p>
And Sibyl, in her deep love and woman's trust, suspecting
nothing, fearing nothing, consented, to the inward
joy and sincere relief of her false lover.
</p>

<p>
Resolving to visit her frequently, and so allay any
suspicions that his absence might give rise to, Willard
Drummond returned to the island and to&mdash;Christie, yielding
himself without further effort to the witching spell of
her love.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom suspected nothing of the contraband courting
carried on under her very eyes.  It was the most natural
thing in the world, she thought, that, in the absence
of Sibyl and her brother, the young man should spend
whole days with them, for it was not pleasant having no
one to talk to but a couple of negroes, as she very well
knew.  Then, it was not to be wondered at, that he
preferred talking and walking with Christie to any of the
rest, for she was "book-l'arned" like himself, which
neither she nor Carl was.  She did wonder a little
sometimes, and said as much to Christie, why he should stay
on the island at all, in the absence of the other.
</p>

<p>
"But, I suppose," was always her conclusion, "It's
because it's Miss Sibyl's home, and, for her sake, he stays
there until she comes."
</p>

<p>
But Christie, though she only blushed and was silent,
was of a different opinion&mdash;one that she would scarcely
own to her own heart.  As to his being in love with
Christie, Mrs. Tom would have scouted the idea with
scorn and unbelief, had she heard it.  Every circumstance
was against such a conclusion.  He was rich, highly
connected, and proud as a prince of the blood; she was poor,
unknown, and, compared with him, uneducated.  Besides,
in the good widow's opinion, she was a child in feeling,
as she certainly was in years, scarcely knowing the
meaning of the word love.
</p>

<p>
Ah! she had been till he came; and his fervid, impassioned
words, his burning glances, his thrilling touch,
had swept away the glamour of childhood and simplicity,
and revealed to her the passionate woman's heart within
her.  His words, his looks, his tones, were all new
revelations to the artless, island maiden, changing her, as if by
magic, from a child to a woman.  She revered him as the
embodiment of all that was brave, generous, and noble;
worshipped him as a god, and loved him with all the
affection of her fresh, young heart, with all the ardor of
a first, deep love.
</p>

<p>
As yet, she knew not whether that love was returned;
for, unfaithful as he was in thought to Sibyl, passion had
not yet so totally conquered his reason as to make him
sin in words.  He had never said, "Christie, I love you;"
but, ah, how often had his eyes said this, and much more;
and how long would this slight barrier stand before the
fiery impetuosity of unstable youth?
</p>

<p>
And so that day passed, and the next, and the next, and
the next, and with every passing hour the temptation
grew stronger and harder to be resisted.  Matters must
come to a crisis now, or never.  Sibyl, in a day or two,
would be home, and this wild frenzy of his could be
hidden no longer.  If she should come, as matters stood
now, all would be lost.
</p>

<p>
And thus, torn between conflicting emotions, Willard
sought Christie, on the day before Sibyl was expected
home, with the determination of bringing this struggle to
an end, then and there.
</p>

<p>
It was a glorious August afternoon.  The island wore
its bright dress of green, and nestled in the blue shining
river like an emerald set in sapphire.  The birds in the
deep pine forest were filling the air with their melody,
and the odor of the wild roses came floating softly on the
summer breeze.
</p>

<p>
But Willard Drummond was in no mood to admire
the beauties of Nature.  The morning had been spent in
pacing up and down his room, hesitating, resolving,
doubting, wishing, yet undecided still.  For, when duty
and principle would appear for a moment victorious, the
waving golden hair, the beautiful blue eyes, the gentle,
loving face of Christie would arise before him, scattering
all his good resolutions to the winds.  And, mingled with
this, there was a sort of superstitious foreboding of evil
to come.  He thought of his dream, and of the yellow-haired
siren luring him on to destruction; and of Sibyl,
fiery daughter of a fiery race, fierce, vindictive, and
implacable in her wrongs.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that I had never met this dark, passionate girl!"
he murmured, distractedly, "who now stands between me
and the heaven of my dreams; or would that I had seen
this beautiful, enchanting Christie first!  Oh, for that
angel as my wife!  And but for those fatal vows once
made to Sibyl, she might be mine.  I was mad, crazed, to
mistake my fancy for that dark, wild-eyed girl for love!
And now, for that one mistake, am I to be wretched for
life?  Shall I give up this beautiful, radiant creature,
who loves me, for one I care for no longer?  No; the
struggle is past.  Christie shall be my bride, and I will
brave the worst that may follow!"
</p>

<p>
He set his teeth hard; and, as if fearing second reflection
might make him change his mind, he left the house
and hurried out to meet Christie.
</p>

<p>
Down on the shore, under the shade of an overhanging
willow, he knew Christie had a favorite seat, where,
on pleasant days, she used to take her work.  Here he
was sure of finding her, and in this direction he bent his
steps.
</p>

<p>
She sat, sewing, under the shade of the drooping willow,
singing softly to herself, and looking like some
sylvan goddess of a sylvan scene; or some beautiful
sea-nymph, just risen from her grotto of coral and chrystal.
</p>

<p>
Radiant and bewildering was the smile and blush with
which she welcomed him&mdash;a smile and blush that might
have been found too strong even for more potent
principles than his.
</p>

<p>
He seated himself beside her, with a look of moody
abstraction, all unusual with him, watching her covertly
from under his eyelashes, as she bent smiling and happy
over her work.
</p>

<p>
For a time, Christie chatted gayly on various commonplace
matters; but, at last, catching her tone from his,
she, too, grew silent and thoughtful.  She bent lower
over her work, wondering if she had offended him, and
involuntarily sighed.
</p>

<p>
He heard it, and said:
</p>

<p>
"And wherefore that sigh, Christie!  Are you unhappy?"
</p>

<p>
"No not unhappy; but troubled."
</p>

<p>
"And why should you be troubled, bright one?  What
can there be to grieve one so fair?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;feared I had offended you," she answered,
timidly.  "You appear out of spirits."
</p>

<p>
"You offend me, gentle one&mdash;you who never offended
any one in your life?  No, no; it is not that."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are unhappy," she said, shyly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am miserable&mdash;wretched!" he cried, vehemently.
"I wish to Heaven I had never been born!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Drummond! what has happened!" she cried,
laying her hand on his, and looking up wistfully in his
face.
</p>

<p>
Her touch, her tone, her look swept away every
remaining trace of fidelity.  He forgot everything he
should have remembered&mdash;his vows, his honor, his truth&mdash;and
saw nothing but the bright, radiant, bewildering
vision before him.  In an instant he was on his knees at
her feet, exclaiming, with impassioned vehemence:
</p>

<p>
"Christie!  Christie! my life, my dream, my hope, I
love you.  See, I am at your feet, where my heart, my
name, my fortune, long have been.  With my whole
heart, and soul, and life, I love you with a love stronger
than death or the grave.  All the devotion and hopes of
my life I offer you, if you can only say you love me."
</p>

<p>
He was pale and panting; his eyes were fierce and
burning; his tones low, thrilling, and passionate.
</p>

<p>
Trembling, shrinking, blushing, yet, with a deep,
intense, fervent joy thrilling through her heart and being,
Christie listened.  The blood swept in torrents to her face,
neck, and bosom, which rose and fell with her rapid
breathing.  She dare not look up to meet his ardent,
burning, gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Christie, Christie! my love, my life! look up;
speak&mdash;answer me&mdash;tell me that you love me!"
</p>

<p>
Still no reply, only those downcast eyes, deepest
blushes, and quick, hurried breathing.
</p>

<p>
"Speak! speak! my beautiful love! only one word
from those sweet lips; but one touch of your dear hand
to tell me I may live," he cried, growing more wild and
impassioned.
</p>

<p>
With a low, glad cry of intense joy, she buried her
blushing face on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks! my heart's thanks for this sweetest, loveliest
Christie!" he cried, with exultant joy, pressing her
yielding form to his bounding heart.  "My life, with all
its hopes, energies, and ambitions, shall be devoted to but
one purpose now&mdash;that of rewarding you for your
priceless love."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Drummond, your love is all the reward I
ask!" she said, in the deep, earnest voice of perfect trust.
</p>

<p>
"Not Mr. Drummond now, sweetest Christie.  I am
<i>Willard</i> to you, now and forever.  Let me always hear
that name in music from your lips, and earth has no
higher boon in store for me."
</p>

<p>
"But oh! can you love me thus&mdash;me, a poor, little,
nameless, uncultured girl, while you are rich,
distinguished, and highly connected.  Oh, Willard, will you
not, some day, repent this choice&mdash;you, who might win
the highest and fairest in the land?"
</p>

<p>
"Repent! never&mdash;never!  Perish my heart, if it ever
admit of any love but thine; palsied be my arm, if it ever
encircle any form but this; accursed be my lips, if they
ever perjure the words I have spoken now; lost forever
be my soul, when it is false to thee!" he cried, with
passionate vehemence.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! dearest, hush!  I do not doubt you&mdash;Heaven
forbid.  I should die, if I thought you could be
false to me."
</p>

<p>
"Speak not of death; it is not for such as you, bright,
beautiful Christie.  And now, only one thing is wanting,
to make me the happiest of men."
</p>

<p>
She lifted her radiant face with a look of earnest
inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"Christie, one little word from you, and ere the sun
rises on a new day, my joy will be complete&mdash;my cup of
earthly happiness will be filled to the brim."
</p>

<p>
Still the same earnest, anxious gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest love, you will not refuse?  It will be but a
small matter to you, and will make me supremely
blessed."
</p>

<p>
"And that?" she inquired, wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Brightest Christie, be my bride&mdash;my wife!" he cried,
folding her closer in his arms, and speaking in a thrilling
whisper.
</p>

<p>
Again the eloquent blood swept over her stainless
neck and bosom, but she did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"You will not refuse me, my own Christie, this last,
greatest favor?  Comply now&mdash;to-day; for if the present
opportunity passes, it may never occur again."
</p>

<p>
"But how&mdash;<i>how</i> can we be wedded here?" she said,
shyly, lifting her eyes to his impassioned ones, and
dropping them in brightest blushes.
</p>

<p>
"Christie, yonder lies a boat; it is three hours to
sunset; long before that time we can reach Westport; there
we can find a clergyman, and there you can become my
own for life!"
</p>

<p>
"But it is so soon&mdash;so sudden," she faltered; "and
Aunt Tom&mdash;she will never consent."
</p>

<p>
"She would not consent any way, fairest Christie.
She would say you were too young&mdash;too far in social
position beneath me.  She would not believe my intentions
honorable.  In short, dearest, she would raise a thousand
objections, and the end would be, that we would be parted
forever."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! it would not be so bad as that; if you
explained it all to her, I think she would consent.  Aunt
Tom is good and kind, and loves me, and would do
anything to make me happy."
</p>

<p>
"That may be, brightest Christie; but that very love
she has for you, and her wish to make you happy, would
cause her to hesitate.  For she would repeat the old,
senseless saying, 'Marry in haste and repent at leisure,' and
think the best way to make us both happy would be to
postpone our marriage for years."
</p>

<p>
"But this secret marriage, it seems wrong&mdash;sinful.
Oh, Willard, my soul revolts from it!  If I could only tell
Aunt Tom!" cried Christie, imploringly.
</p>

<p>
"When the proper time comes, dearest love, she shall
know, and the world shall behold my beautiful bride.
But until then, you must have confidence in me, and
wait."
</p>

<p>
"But, oh!  I have such a presentiment of what may
follow, Willard&mdash;such a cloud seems to enshroud this
secret marriage, that my very soul shrinks from it in fear."
</p>

<p>
"Christie," he said, drawing back, and speaking in a
deeply offended tone, "you do not love me!"
</p>

<p>
She raised her bright, beautiful eyes, so full of love
and devotion, but did not speak.  No words could have
told such a tale of perfect, intense love, as did that quick,
eloquent glance.
</p>

<p>
"You do not love me," he went on, in the same deeply
hurt tone; "you have no confidence in me, no trust, no
faith.  I have given you my reasons, good and valid to
any one else, but of no avail with you.  If you cared for
me, you would be content to wait, with perfect trust in
my love; but I see you will not trust me.  Be it so; there
remains nothing for me but to leave you forever."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard!" was all she could say, as her voice was
choked in tears.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I had found an artless, loving, trusting
girl," he went on, with increased bitterness; "but I have
found one who will not yield in the slightest iota, lest she
should compromise herself in the eyes of the world, who
fears what it will say of her more than she loves me!
Farewell, Christie! we have met for the last time.  Since
you care for your aunt more than for me, I leave you to
her."
</p>

<p>
He arose, coldly and haughtily, to go.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! do not leave me!" was her passionate
cry.  "I will do anything, be anything you ask, only do
not leave me in anger!"
</p>

<p>
"Will you be my wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"To-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes! to-night and forever!"
</p>

<p>
"My own gentle love!" he whispered, pressing her
fondly in his arms, "will you go and get ready, and return
to me here in a quarter of an hour?"
</p>

<p>
"But what shall I say to Aunt Tom&mdash;how account for
my absence?"
</p>

<p>
"Leave that to me, dearest.  In a few minutes I will
follow you to the cottage, and ask her to let you take a
sail with me on the river by moonlight; she will not
refuse me."
</p>

<p>
"As you will," said Christie, turning toward her home.
While Willard, triumphant, exulting, and dizzy with joy,
descended to the beach to prepare the boat.
</p>

CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
THE VISION OF THE ISLE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "But soft: behold! lo, where it comes again!<br>
  I'll cross it though it blast me.  Stay, illusion!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou hast any sound, or use a voice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak to me!"&mdash;HAMLET.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Fickle fortune, that often favors the wrong and
erring, certainly smiled on the lovers that day.  For
scarcely had Christie entered the house, when Mrs. Tom
came bustling out, in deep distress, saying, in
heart-rending tones:
</p>

<p>
"What is to be done?  This five-and-forty year, rain or
shine, I've had a cup o' tea for breakfast; and, now, there
ain't a grain in the house.  I jest know, as well as if
somebody told me, that I won't be fit for nothin' to-morrow,
when I ain't got a cup o' tea for my breakfast; and there's
no use tryin' to make that there good-for-nothin' Carl, go
for any to-night.  It allers was my luck to have the most
dreadfulest bad luck, but I never thought things would
come to sich a pass as this.  Scat! you hussy!"  And
Mrs. Tom gave the cat a kick, which was her usual way
of winding up an address.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Tom," said Christie, "let me go."
</p>

<p>
"You!  Are you crazy?  How are you goin' to go?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Drummond is going over to Westport this
evening, and he wanted me to go with him," said Christie,
turning away to hide a rising blush.  "I can easily get it
there."
</p>

<p>
"So you can," said Mrs. Tom, considering; "but will
Mr. Drummond return early?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Christie; "he has some slight <i>business</i> to
transact, and then he is coming immediately home.  The
sail will be pleasant by moonlight, and I'd like to go."
</p>

<p>
"Well, go, then; and don't be gone any longer than
you can help.  Get two poun's of hyson at Mr. Ginger's."
</p>

<p>
"Yes ma'am," said Christie, taking the money, and
putting on her hat and shawl, in a trembling, agitated
way, that at any other time Mrs. Tom must have noticed.
</p>

<p>
She hurried out, and on her way met Willard coming
up to the house.
</p>

<p>
"Well, has Mrs. Tom given you permission?" he
asked, in pleased surprise.
</p>

<p>
Christie related her errand.
</p>

<p>
"The gods favor us!" he cried, gayly.  "See, Christie! the
sun is approaching the west, and before it dies out of
the sky, you will be what Heaven has destined you
for&mdash;my wife!"
</p>

<p>
"And to be that for one hour, is bliss enough to repay
for a whole life of misery," she said, with heartfelt
earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"With my own Christie!  Will I ever be able to repay
you for this grace, this greatest earthly blessing that
Heaven could bestow upon me?" he said, fervently.
</p>

<p>
"The knowledge of your love more than repays me;
for I have made no sacrifice," she said, in a low tone.
</p>

<p>
They had now reached the boat.  He handed her in,
pushed off the boat, took the oars, and rowed away.
</p>

<p>
But other eyes they dreamed not of were upon them.
From one of the windows of the high chambers of
Campbell's Lodge, Aunt Moll and her son, Lem, were taking
observations.
</p>

<p>
"Dar dey go!&mdash;off a sailin'.  What will Miss Sibyl
say to dat?" observed the indignant Aunt Moll.
</p>

<p>
"Goin' out sailin' doesn't signify nothin'.  De young
gemblum wants somebody to talk to as he rows."
</p>

<p>
"'Tain't right," said Aunt Moll, with an oracular
shake of the head; "dar's sumfin wrong, somewhere.
Don't b'lieve Miss Sibyl would 'prove of it, nohow; dese
yer young men ain't to be trusted nowadays."
</p>

<p>
"It's nat'ral Marse Drummin' would get tired o' one
gal&mdash;mos' young men do&mdash;and take up wid anoder, for a
change.  I'd do it myself," concluded Lem, in a pompous
tone.
</p>

<p>
"You would?" said his mother, in high dudgeon; "as
if any gal 'd look at you, you brack fool.  Marse Drummin'
will get hisself inter a hornet's nest, if he trifles wid
de 'fections ob Miss Sibyl.  I's come to de disclusion to
conform Miss Sibyl ob his goings on, soon as ebber she
arrives.  Dar!"
</p>

<p>
And having thus settled the matter to her own entire
satisfaction, Aunt Moll descended to the kitchen, and
soon forgot all sublunary things in the celestial bliss of
smoking a short, dirty pipe, as black and stumpy as
herself.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the erring young pair were swiftly skimming
over the bright waters in the direction of Westport.
The labor of rowing precluded the possibility of
conversation, and both were silent and thoughtful.  Urged on
by his intense desire of completing what he had so
successfully begun&mdash;urged on, perhaps, by Fate&mdash;the boat
seemed fairly to fly over the sparkling, sun-bright waves.
</p>

<p>
Ere the last ray of sunlight had faded from the sky
the boat touched the opposite shore; and drawing Christie's
arm within his own, Willard set off rapidly in the
direction of the town of Westport.
</p>

<p>
And having reached it, he led Christie in the direction
of a little obscure Methodist chapel, while he left her to
seek for a license and the clergyman.
</p>

<p>
In a short time he returned with both, and without
asking any unnecessary inquiries, he hastened through
the marriage ceremony; and in a few moments the
passion-blinded young couple were man and wife.  Then
hastily paying the clergyman his fee, Willard led his
bride from the church.
</p>

<p>
"My bride! my wife! my own forever, now!" he
cried, with passionate exultation, folding her to his heart.
</p>

<p>
But just then, with a sharp, piercing cry of thrilling
horror, Christie sprang back, frightfully pale&mdash;with
dilating eyes and choking breath, gasping, stifling,
suffocating.
</p>

<p>
"In the name of Heaven! what is the matter, my own
Christie?" he cried, in wonder and alarm.
</p>

<p>
But, pressing her hands over her heart, she sank dizzily
on the church steps, pale, gasping, trembling,
horror-stricken still.
</p>

<p>
"Christie!  Christie! dearest love!  what is it?" he said,
anxiously, encircling her with his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! the doom&mdash;the doom!" she said, shudderingly
hiding her face in his arm.
</p>

<p>
"What doom?  Of what are you speaking, sweet wife?"
he inquired, in increasing anxiety.
</p>

<p>
She rose now, and passed her hand over her brow, as
if to clear away a mist.  Then, seeing his pale, troubled
face, she recovered herself and forced a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Christie, what was it?" he anxiously asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! you will laugh at me, but I felt it all, I
saw it all so plainly," she said, in a weeping voice.
</p>

<p>
"Saw what&mdash;felt what?  I do not understand," he said,
puzzled by her look and words.
</p>

<p>
"Those eyes! those eyes! and that fierce grasp on my
throat, and the keen knife!  Ah, Heaven!  I feel it
yet."  And she shuddered convulsively.
</p>

<p>
"Are you raving, Christie!  In Heaven's name, what
eyes, what knife, are you speaking of?" he said, beginning
to think she had lost her reason.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard!  Willard! just as you folded me in your
arms, and called me your wife, Sibyl Campbell's fierce,
wild, black eyes rose before me, glaring on me like
burning coals, and then I felt two strong hands clutch my
throat, and a knife plunged into my breast!  Oh, saints
in heaven! it rises before me yet."
</p>

<p>
"Christie, you are mad!" he said, vehemently; but the
ashen paleness that overspread his face told the sudden
shock the name of Sibyl had given him.
</p>

<p>
In all the terror, horror, and momentary frenzy of that
instant, the fear of his displeasure conquered every other
feeling in her breast.  Shaking off, with an effort, the
creeping dread that was palsying every nerve, she clung
to his arm with renewed confidence, and said, with a deep
breath of relief:
</p>

<p>
"I believe I was, for the moment, Willard; but that
has passed now.  You are not angry with me, dearest
Willard?" she said, anxiously, observing the cloud that
still overspread his fine face.
</p>

<p>
"Angry? not at all!" he said, gravely.  "Only sorry
and surprised to think you should give way to such
extraordinary delusions."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! it was not a delusion.  I saw it all, as
plainly as I see you now.  Oh, those dreadful, dreadful
eyes! they will haunt me to my dying day!"
</p>

<p>
"Do not think of it again, my own love, and do not
look so wild," he said, soothingly.  "Come, let us be
going; the moon will soon rise, and it will be late before
we reach the isle."
</p>

<p>
"And Aunt Tom will be anxious," said Christie.  "And
that reminds me of her commission, which I had nearly
forgotten.  When we reach the store, you can wait
outside.  I will join you in a moment."
</p>

<p>
The moon was just rising when they set sail for the
isle, which Christie had left a child, and was returning a
wife.  Ah! where was their better angel in that dark
moment of madness and temptation?
</p>

<p>
The soft, bright moonlight was lighting up the isle
with its calm, pale rays when they reached it.  The cry
of the whip-poor-will and katy-did, from the neighboring
forest, mingled with the soft, dreamy murmur of the
waves on the shore, was the sweetest music ever heard.
</p>

<p>
Tempted by the beauty of the night, our lovers prolonged
their stroll over the beach.  At length, as it began
to grow late, Christie, fearing Mrs. Tom or Carl might
come out to watch for her coming, persuaded Willard to
let her return.
</p>

<p>
They walked up the rocky, romantic path, whispering
those low and often foolish things so sweet to lovers' ears
when coming from the lips of the loved one.  A light
still twinkled in the widow's cottage, casting a long, thin
line of yellow light far over the lonely road.  But no
other sign of life was visible.  Christie's blue eyes were
bent on the ground, and Willard's stately head was bent
above her, when, suddenly looking up, he beheld a sight
which froze the blood in his veins.
</p>

<p>
From the dark, mystic pine woods, a white-robed figure
came floating toward them.  One glance sufficed to tell
him it was the strange vision that had bent over him a
few nights before.  There were the same hollow, ray less
eyes, the same wild, streaming black hair, the same ghastly
corpse-like face, with its fixed look of unutterable woe.
</p>

<p>
It was coming steadily toward them, this awful phantom.
Willard stood fixed, rooted to the ground, gazing
as if fascinated on the appalling specter.  His next
thought was for Christie.  He glanced toward her to see
her face blanched to the hue of death, her eyes dilating
in horror, fixed, frozen, unable to speak a word, one hand
raised, and one flickering finger pointing to the dread
being approaching.
</p>

<p>
Neither could move nor speak.  Still the phantom
floated on until it stood before them, face to face.  For
an instant it paused, with its hollow eyes glaring upon
them; then with an awful cry of "murdered! murdered!"
that peeled through the dim old woods, it threw up both
its arms, and with a shrill, piercing, agonizing shriek,
fled away and was hid among the beetling rocks.
</p>

<p>
The hand that grasped Willard's arm was growing
weaker and weaker, there was a low moan, and he turned
in time to catch the senseless form of his child-wife in
his arms.
</p>

<p>
The wild, unearthly scream had startled Mrs. Tom.
Alarmed and wondering, she cautiously opened the door
and went out.  And there she saw Willard Drummond
with the senseless form of Christie in his arms.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
ONE OF FORTUNE'S SMILES.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortune is merry,<br>
  And in this mood will give us anything."&mdash;JULIUS CÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â SAR.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Captain Guy Campbell sat in the parlor of
the Westport House, as the flaming gilt
signboard announced, his heels elevated on the
window-sill, his chair tipped back, a cigar in his mouth, and
a newspaper in his hand.  Many people were passing in
and out, some of whom he greeted with a nod, others
with a brief salutation, while he still went on with his
reading and smoking.  There seemed to be nothing very
exciting in the paper, judging by Captain Campbell's
suppressed yawns; and he was about to throw it aside as
worthless, when a paragraph caught his eye, that brought
him to his feet, as suddenly as though those members
were furnished with steel springs.
</p>

<p>
The paragraph was brief, and ran thus:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"If Mark Campbell, Esq., of Campbell's Isle, be still
alive, he is earnestly requested to call immediately at the
office of C. Ringdon, Attorney-at-Law, No 16 &mdash;&mdash; street,
Westport.  In case of his death, his heirs should apply.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
C. RINGDON."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Now, what in the name of Neptune and all his scaly
court can this mean?" ejaculated the amazed Captain
Campbell.
</p>

<p>
"Should be happy to inform you," said a voice behind
him, "only I don't happen to know what you're talking
about."
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell turned round, and saw a fashionably
dressed young man, who had just entered, standing
beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Stafford! how are you?" he said, extending his
hand; "happy to see you.  What in the world brought
you here?&mdash;the very last person I ever expected to see in
this quarter of the globe."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Stafford, leisurely seating himself, "I
came down here, nominally, to transact some business
for the governor; but the fact is, I heard the Evening
Star had arrived, and I wanted to pay my devoirs to her
majesty, the Queen of the Isle.  How is pretty Lady
Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, and at present on a visit to the
Rev. Mr. Brantwell's.  But look at this advertisement, here, in the
Westport <i>Herald</i>.  What the deuce do you make of it?"
</p>

<p>
Stafford took the paper and carelessly glanced over
the lines.
</p>

<p>
"Faith, I don't know.  Somebody's left you a legacy,
perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh! what a notion!  Who under the sun is there
to leave a legacy to me?  The Campbells are all as poor
as Job's turkey."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's your mother's relations&mdash;the Eyres.
Old Richard Eyre, the New York banker, is a millionaire,
worth more hundred thousand dollars than I could
undertake to count.  He might have died and left you his
money."
</p>

<p>
"And leave his own family without?  A likely story,"
said Captain Campbell.
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow, he had no family, except a wife, and
she has been dead for many years.  You may be certain
he has left you his heir."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove! if it should prove to be true, that would be
a streak of good luck.  But it cannot be.  Dame Fortune
would never bestow on a Campbell any such friendly
smile.  They always were an impoverished race, and
always will be, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too confident.  Strange things happen sometimes.
For instance, I saw something strange a night or
two ago.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Weil, you see, about dark I was wandering about the
shore, enjoying a cigar and the beauty of the evening,
and ruminating whether it wouldn't be advisable to take
a boat and go over to see her adorable majesty, Queen
Sibyl.  Most likely my cogitation would have ended in
my going, only, unfortunately, there was no boat to be
seen.  I was about to turn away in despair, when I
suddenly espied a boat containing two persons land at some
distance below where I stood.  One was a young fellow,
tall and good looking, with a certain air of aristocratic
hauteur about him that told me he was not to be
interfered with.  But his companion&mdash;oh, ye gods and little
fishes! what a perfect little sylph she was!  Such a
miraculous combination of blue eyes, yellow curls, snowy
complexion, pink cheeks, and red, kissable lips, it never was
my good fortune to encounter before.  But what struck
me most forcibly, was her resemblance to some one I had
seen before and after puzzling myself for a long time, I
at length discovered she was the very image of pretty
little Christie, of the isle."
</p>

<p>
"Christie! oh, pooh! it couldn't have been she," said
Captain Campbell, with an uneasy start.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, it couldn't have been she, with so dainty a
knight as that, but it was most confoundedly like her, or
what she was when I saw her last&mdash;four years ago;
though I dare say she has greatly changed since then."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what was there so strange about a handsome
fellow and a pretty girl landing on the beach, to interest
the nonchalant Will Stafford?" asked Captain Campbell.
</p>

<p>
"Listen&mdash;I haven't got to the strange part of my story
yet.  They walked up the beach to the road, and I could
see the girl was terrified and excited, while he tried to
soothe and quiet her.  My curiosity was aroused; for,
'pon my soul, Campbell, I never saw a lovelier little
creature; and with a sort of idea they were up to some
mischief, I followed them.  It was nearly dark, and they
hurried on so fast they did not notice me, and I tracked
them into one of the most obscure streets of the town,
and saw them enter a little, secluded, Methodist
meeting-house.'
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said his auditor.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, the fellow left her there and went off.  I
crept softly in, and in the obscurity hid behind a post,
determined to see the end.  Dark as it was, I could see
she trembled with inward emotion, and crouched down
in her seat, with her face hidden in her hands, as if terror,
remorse, sorrow, or some other feeling, was weighing
down her heart."
</p>

<p>
"Wonder the gay Will Stafford did not approach and
offer her consolation," said the young captain, dryly.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!  I felt like doing it," said Mr. Stafford, in
all sincerity; "but I wanted to see what was up, for I
knew now all could not be quite right.  Presently, the
young man came back, and with him a minister.  All was
clear as stars at noonday, now&mdash;this was a runaway
match, a clandestine marriage&mdash;something which is always
interesting to fast young men like myself.  The happy
pair stood up before the clergyman, and the twain were
soon made one flesh.
</p>

<p>
"My ears would have run themselves into points in
order to hear the better, but I listened in vain.  The
minister mumbled over the ceremony so confoundedly low
that I could not hear a single word&mdash;not even the names
of the parties, which I was particularly anxious to find
out.  I suppose it was all right, however, for I saw the
clergyman pocket the fee, and the young man, tucking
little blue-eyes under his arm, walked off; and, faith,
I'd given a trifle to have stood in his place.  I followed,
not being ambitious to be locked up all night, even in so
holy a place as a church.  Just as I went out, I heard an
awful shriek, and there the bride stood like one suddenly
turned to stone, while the bridegroom was trying to
console her.  What scared her I don't know, but certainly I
never saw a more terrified look on any face than was on
hers.  Not wishing to be seen, I drew back, and in a few
minutes they started on.  I followed them as before, and
saw the girl stop for a moment in a grocery store, while
he waited outside.  Then they went down to the beach,
he handed her into the boat, pushed off, and they were
gone&mdash;leaving me to rub my eyes and wonder whether I
was sleeping or waking.  Now, what do you think of this
wedding on the sly, without friends, or witnesses, or
anything in the usual line?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, really, I cannot say, such things do not interest
me as deeply as they do you.  Perhaps it's the
Westport fashion."
</p>

<p>
"No; there's something wrong.  He was evidently of
a rank superior to the girl.  I could tell that, both by
their dress and air, and general appearance.  I <i>would</i> like
to get at the bottom of this mystery."
</p>

<p>
"Then why not see the minister who married them,
and find out from him?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, for sundry reasons.  First, I didn't see his face,
and wouldn't know him if I stumbled over him.  Second,
it looks like a rascally, low-bred trick; this tracking
them and playing the spy, that I should be ashamed to
tell any one of it, but so old a friend as you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, never mind this mysterious couple any
more," said Captain Campbell, impatiently; "but tell me
what I had better do about this advertisement."
</p>

<p>
"Why, go and see this C. Ringdon, attorney-at-law, at
once, that's all; I'll go with you; it's not ten minutes'
walk from here."
</p>

<p>
"But if it should prove to be a humbug?" said Captain
Campbell, as he sallied forth, arm-in-arm with Stafford.
</p>

<p>
"Then thrash C. Ringdon, attorney-at-law, within an
inch of his life," said his pacific friend.  "It's the only
balm for a wounded mind I know of."
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell laughed; and the conversation
turned on various matters as they walked on.
</p>

<p>
In a short time they reached the office of C. Ringdon&mdash;a
dingy-looking, old house, with his name over the
door, in exceedingly dingy letters.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ringdon, a sharp, shrewd-looking little man, sat
alone in his office, when they entered.  He pushed up his
spectacles, and surveyed them keenly as they came in.
</p>

<p>
"You, I presume, are the Mr. Ringdon mentioned in
this advertisement?" said Captain Campbell, handing
him the paper, and pointing to the advertisement.
</p>

<p>
"I am sir.  Can you give me any information concerning
the parties in question?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith, he ought to, being the principal party in
question himself," interposed Stafford.
</p>

<p>
"How, sir,&mdash;are you a relative of these Campbells of
the Isle?" asked the attorney.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; the son of the Mark Campbell mentioned there."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Are there any more of you?  Is your father
living?"
</p>

<p>
"No; he has been dead these four years; and there are
<i>no more of us</i>, as you are pleased to term it, but one sister.
May I ask what all this affair is about?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Mr. Campbell.  You are aware, perhaps,
you had an uncle in New York&mdash;-Mr. Richard Eyre, the
banker?"
</p>

<p>
"I knew it!  Wasn't I just saying the old gentleman
was at the bottom of it?" said Stafford, giving Captain
Campbell a dig in the ribs.
</p>

<p>
"I am aware of that fact, sir; he was my mother's
only brother."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  Well, he is dead."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said the young man, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; and, having no heirs of his own, he has left
his whole fortune to be divided equally between his
sister's children.  The sum is enormous; and I beg leave to
congratulate you on your good fortune.  I do not know
the exact amount, and for further particulars it will be
necessary for you to visit New York, where the lawyer
who drew up the will resides.  Here is his address.  All
you have to do, is to prove your identity, settle a few
preliminaries, and take immediate possession of your
fortune.  Excuse me, gentlemen, I am very busy, and, with
your permission, will bid you good-morning."
</p>

<p>
And the little attorney bowed them politely out.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this is a streak of good luck!" exclaimed
Stafford.  "Upon my word, Campbell, you must have been
born with a silver spoon in your mouth.  I suppose you
will start instantly for New York?"
</p>

<p>
"Not instantly, my dear Stafford.  I must go and inform
Sibyl of our good fortune.  Dear, noble girl, for
her sake I am truly thankful for this."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you ought to be; not many men are blessed
with such a sister as that radiant, glorious Sibyl.  Have
you any objections to my accompanying you?"
</p>

<p>
"Delighted to have you, my dear fellow.  Suppose
we start now; we will be at Brantwell's before dark."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please, my dear sir.  I suppose it will be
'sight for sair een' to see her dazzling majesty, the Queen
of the Isle, again."
</p>

<p>
A carriage was soon in readiness, and our two friends
started to impart this sudden glimpse of fortune's
sunshine to Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
It was dark when they reached the parsonage&mdash;a
handsome and rather imposing-looking mansion&mdash;and were
ushered into the drawing-room by a neat-looking little
maid.  Sibyl and Mrs. Brantwell were seated alone,
Mr. Brantwell having gone to see a sick parishioner.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl joyfully hailed her brother, and smilingly greeted
his companion, who was an old friend and secret admirer.
Poor Will Stafford!  The impressions the child Sibyl had
formerly made on his heart, time had nearly obliterated;
but that radiant smile, those glorious eyes and bewitching
glance, totally finished him.
</p>

<p>
Good Mrs. Brantwell welcomed her guests in her usual
hearty manner, and with a jolly little laugh.  But when
she heard of the unexpected good fortune of Sibyl and
her brother, her rapturous delight knew no bounds.
</p>

<p>
"Just to think of it!" she exclaimed, "my handsome
Sibyl an heiress.  Oh, won't she create an excitement
now?  Young, rich, and beautiful!  Sibyl!  Sibyl! what
an enviable fate is yours!"
</p>

<p>
Sibyl's cheek flushed, and her eyes brightened, as she
thought of Willard.  For <i>his</i> sake she rejoiced over her
new-found fortune.  Often and bitterly had she secretly
regretted, and her pride revolted at the idea of becoming
the bride of one so far superior in wealth and fortune.
But now she was his equal! there was triumph, joy,
exultation in the thought.  His aristocratic friends could
not look down on her now&mdash;could not despise her for her
poverty.  Look down on her&mdash;a Campbell of the Isle!  In
other days, who would have dared to do so and live?
But times had changed since those days; and people
looked more now to dollars and dimes than to blood or
noble ancestry.  Now she had both; she was his equal in
wealth, as she was infinitely his superior in every noble
quality, and the triumphant thought sent the blood rushing
to her crimson cheeks, her red, glowing lips, and the
dark, Southern eyes of jet, lit up magnificently with
pride, love, and exultation.  This fortune of hers she
would cast at his feet, with her passionate devotion, as
she had already cast heart, and life, and being, and soul.
</p>

<p>
"What are you thinking of, Sibyl?" said Captain
Campbell, after watching her a few moments, with a
smile.  "Your cheeks and eyes are blazing, your whole
face illuminated, as it were, with an inward light of joy
and triumph.  Surely you do not care as much as this for
wealth?"
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!  I know what it's all about," broke in
Mrs. Brantwell, in her customary matter-of-fact manner.
"She's thinking that good-looking Mr. Drummond will
have a richer bride than he bargained for.  Isn't that so,
Mistress Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
Sibyl started from her reverie, and blushed deeply at
finding her thoughts thus interpreted.  Stafford turned
pale as he watched her glowing face; and the conviction
came home to him, for the first time, that Sibyl Campbell's
rare beauty was appreciated by other eyes than his.
</p>

<p>
"By the way, when was Drummond here?" asked Captain
Campbell.
</p>

<p>
"Day before yesterday&mdash;wasn't it, Sibyl?  He doesn't
visit us very often&mdash;not half so often as so devoted a lover
should.  Oh, you needn't try to annihilate me with those
flashing eyes of yours, my lady.  I'm not a young gentleman,
thank goodness! and am proof against even those
bright, angry glances.  To be sure the young man may
have some plausible excuse; but it seems to me if I were
in his place I'd stick to you like a chesnut-burr, for fear
you might slip through my fingers.  Poor, dear
Mr. Brantwell was twice as attentive in his courting days,
and I never had any beauty worth mentioning," said
Mrs. Brantwell, with her usual jolly laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that, my dear lady," said Guy,
gayly.  "If I were a marrying man, I'd sooner bend my
knees to you than half the young girls I know.  Only I've
an immense respect for Mr. Brantwell, there is no telling
what I might be tempted to do."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too confident, Master Guy," said the
good-humored lady.  "I wouldn't have anything to do with
such a graceless young scamp as you for any consideration;
though, for the sake of sound morality and good
taste, I should hope you wouldn't fall in love with me.
And here comes Mr. Brantwell himself, who wouldn't
approve of it, by any means."
</p>

<p>
At this moment the good clergyman entered, and
warmly greeted his guests.
</p>

<p>
In a few words his wife told him of this astonishing
good fortune.  Mr. Brantwell always took matters very
coolly, a circumstance which sometimes provoked his
more excitable lady, as on the present occasion&mdash;he
merely elevated his eyebrows slightly in token of
surprise, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed!" responded his wife, irreverently
mimicking his tone, "and one would think fortunes were in
the habit of pouring into people's hands as they walked,
by the way you take it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, where is the use of flying off at a tangent at
everything," retorted her spouse, "as you do.  I suppose,
captain, you will start for New York immediately?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, to-morrow morning."
</p>

<p>
"And as Sibyl may be wanted, you had better take
her, too," said Mr. Brantwell.
</p>

<p>
"Very true; I never thought of it before.  Can you
be ready, Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
Sibyl thought of Drummond, and asked, rather
hesitatingly, "How long will you be gone?"
</p>

<p>
"About a week&mdash;or two or three, at the farthest."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Sibyl," broke in Mrs. Brantwell, who seemed
to possess the faculty of reading people's thoughts,
"never mind Mr. Drummond; I'll break the news of
your absence to him in the gentlest manner possible.
Your fortune is of more importance just now than his
lordship, who, no doubt, will follow you to New York
when he hears you are there."
</p>

<p>
There was no use getting angry with the good-humored
old lady, so Sibyl smiled, and promised to ready betimes
next morning.
</p>

<p>
And early the following day the brother and sister set
out for New York.

CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
THE STORM&mdash;THE WRECK.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "The strife of fiends is in the battling clouds,<br>
  The glare of hell is in these sulphurous lightnings!<br>
  This is no earthly storm."&mdash;BERTRAM.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was two days after the departure of Sibyl ere
Willard Drummond visited the parsonage again.
And then he heard of her departure with real surprise
and affected concern; but he did not follow her to
New York, as Mrs. Brantwell had prophesied.
</p>

<p>
His passion for Christie was yet too new&mdash;the novelty
had not worn off&mdash;the joy of knowing she was his wife,
his own indisputable property, had not yet abated, as it
would do some day, as it must do; for such quick, fierce,
passionate, selfish love could not last.  As suddenly, as
completely, as it had come, so must it die; for he was not
one of those who, in loving once love for a life-time.
Christie was, and so was Sibyl; but in each that love
despised, or neglected, would produce different results.
</p>

<p>
Christie would have folded her hands, drooped, faded,
and perhaps died of a broken heart, but Sibyl would rise
majestic with the strength of her wrongs, and hurl to
destruction all those who had acted a part in her
downfall.  Something of all this would at times flit through
Willard Drummond's mind; and once came the ungenerous
thought that perhaps after all it would have been
better had he never seen Campbell's Isle.  But one smile
from Christie, one fond caress from her gentle arms,
and all this was forgotten, and all the world was again
bounded for him by its wave-dashed shore.
</p>

<p>
So the days of Sibyl's absence were wearing away, and
Willard still lingered a willing captive.  Even Mrs. Tom's
eyes were beginning to be opened to the fact that there
must be <i>something</i> more than met the eye in these long
solitary rambles&mdash;those moonlight walks and sails the
young couple were so fond of.  Aunt Moll had long been
throwing out sundry mysterious hints which Mrs. Tom&mdash;who
disliked gossiping&mdash;paid no attention to; but now
she began to think that, after all, it might be more
prudent to keep this gay young man of pleasure a little
oftener from Christie.  So one day she surprised Christie
by a sound scolding on her "goin' prowlin' through the
woods at all hours, when she ought to be at home doing
her work," and positively forbidding her going out again
for a week.
</p>

<p>
Christie listened in dutiful silence, but promised
nothing; and in spite of all Mrs. Tom's watching, met
Willard as often as ever.  For that young gentleman
would visit the cottage each day; and the little widow
was altogether too hospitable to hint that he came oftener
than was exactly desirable.  And so there was nothing to
do but to hope that Miss Sibyl would soon return to the
isle, and look after her lover herself, for Mrs. Tom was
growing tired of it.  Besides, she really liked the youth
exceedingly, and would have thought him a paragon of
perfection if he only would be less attentive to Christie.
</p>

<p>
And Christie, the sly little child-wife, had gone on
dreaming "Love's young dream," and never thinking how
terrible one day would be her waking.
</p>

<p>
Since their bridal-night, the mysterious phantom had
never been seen; and both were beginning to hope it
had been only an illusion of a heated imagination.
Mr. Drummond had accounted for the terrifying shriek and
Christie's fainting fit in some ingenious way of his own,
that quite satisfied the old lady, and lulled to sleep any
suspicions she might have conceived.
</p>

<p>
One evening, as Willard set out to keep an appointment
with Christie, he observed Lem standing, or rather
sitting perched up on a limb of a giant pine tree, shading
his eyes with his hands, and looking anxiously out to sea.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my boy, what has caught your attention in
that direction&mdash;wild geese?"
</p>

<p>
"No, master," said Lem, solemnly; "I see a sail."
</p>

<p>
"Well, and what of that?" said Mr. Drummond.  "A
sail is not such an unusual sight here, is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Bur dare's a storm brewing an' if de Lord ain't took
'special charge ob dat vessel, de fust lan' it makes will be
Davy Jones' locker," said Lem.
</p>

<p>
"A storm, you blockhead!" exclaimed Drummond,
"There is not a cloud in the sky."
</p>

<p>
"Jes' look ober dar, massa, and see dat black cloud,
'bout de size o' your hand."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Willard.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty soon dat will be all ober the sky, and den we'll
hab a taring squall.  De trees tell de wind's risin' already,
and you needn't be s'prised ef to-morrow mornin' you
sees de ruins o' dat wessel spread all over the shore."
</p>

<p>
And Lem, with a doleful shake of his head, descended
from his perch and sought the house.
</p>

<p>
Ere the hour had passed, Lem's prognostications
proved true.  The heavens rapidly darkened, as dense,
black, threatening clouds rolled over it; the sea became
of an inky hue, crested with white, ghastly-looking foam,
as it heaved and groaned like a "strong heart in strong
agony," The wind rose and crashed with terrific force
through the woods, bending strong trees like reeds before
its might.
</p>

<p>
"Lor' sakes, how it blows!" said Mrs. Tom, as she
blustered in and out.  "I 'clare to man, it 'most took me
right off my feet.  I ain't heerd sich a wind these five year
come Christmas, and them two ships were wrecked right
out from the shore, and every soul perished.  Dear,
dear! what a sight it was next day, when all the drowned
corpses was washed ashore.  It was the most awfulest
sight I ever seed.  Carl, don't sit layin' there in the
corner all night, toastin' your shins like a singed cat.  Get
up and pick the pen-feathers out of that fowl."
</p>

<p>
"I heard Lem saying there was a ship in view about an
hour ago," said Drummond, rising.
</p>

<p>
"Lord a' massy upon them, then!" said Mrs. Tom;
"for, if they touch the shore, they'll every one go to the
bottom.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dreadful!" said Christie, turning pale with pity
and horror.
</p>

<p>
"It's goin' to be an awful night!  Just listen to the
wind roarin' through the trees, and that rain!  I never
heard the waves boomin' on the beach as they're doin'
now, that a wreck didn't foller.  It's a blessin' Captain
Guy and Miss Sibyl ain't on the sea this dreadful night.
When they were away, I used to think of them in every
storm.  Lord preserve us! look at that."  And, with a
piercing shriek, the startled Mrs. Tom sprang back.
</p>

<p>
A fierce gust of wind, threatening to bring down the
roof about their heads; a tempestuous dash of rain, as if
the flood-gates of heaven had opened for a second deluge;
a blaze of blue, livid lightning, as though the whole
firmament was one sheet of flame; a crash of thunder, as
though heaven and earth were rending asunder!
</p>

<p>
With a wild cry of terror, Christie sprang up pale,
trembling, horror-struck.  Carl crouched into a ball in a
remote corner.  Neither dared to speak or move.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom, forgetting her first involuntary alarm,
sprang to close the shutters, and make fast the doors.
And Willard, amazed at the suddenness with which the
storm had arisen, buttoned up his coat, preparatory to
starting for the lodge, ere it should further increase in
violence.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do not go&mdash;do not leave us!" cried Christie,
springing forward, and pale, wild, terror-stricken,
clinging to him, scarcely conscious of what she did.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest love, do not tremble so; there is no danger,"
he whispered, encouragingly, encircling her slight waist
with his arm.
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Tom, turning suddenly around, and beholding
them in this position, in spite of her panic, was
shocked and indignant.
</p>

<p>
"Lor' a' massy 'pon us, child, sit down&mdash;no, kneel
down, and say your prayers.  You ought to be ashamed
of yourself to do sich a thing.  Mr. Drummond, I'd be
'bliged to you not to keep your arm 'round her that way;
it doesn't look right, nor, likewise, respectable."
</p>

<p>
But here, Mrs. Tom's words were abruptly cut short;
for, across the stormy, raging sea, high above the roar
and shrieking of the storm, pealed a minute-gun of a ship
in distress, like an agonized cry for help.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven be merciful!  Listen to that!" exclaimed
Mrs. Tom, turning pale.
</p>

<p>
Another fierce, tempestuous burst of wind and rain
another blinding glare of sulphurous lightning; another
appalling peal of deafening thunder rent the air.  And
then again boomed the minute-gun over the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Something must be done; something shall be done!"
cried Willard, excited beyond endurance, at the thought
of so many perishing almost within a dozen rods of where
he stood.  "Carl, my boy, come with me; and, with the
assistance of Lem, we may be able to save some of those
perishing wretches."
</p>

<p>
"It's too wet!" said a terrified voice, from the corner,
as its owner crouched into a still smaller ball.
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Tom&mdash;who never forgot the practical no
matter what her alarm might be&mdash;went over, and taking
the unfortunate youth by both ears, lifted him, with a
jerk, to his feet.
</p>

<p>
With a howl of pain, Carl extricated himself from her
hands, and clapped both his own palms over the injured
members.
</p>

<p>
"Now, go this minute, and get your hat and overcoat,
and go out with Mr. Drummond, and do whatever you
can.  And if he goes laying around, just give him a blow
'long side of the head, and make him know he's got to
mind you.  Come, be quick!"
</p>

<p>
Carl, whose dread of the storm was far inferior to his
dread of Mrs. Tom, donned his coat and hat with amazing
alacrity&mdash;having tied the former under his chin, with a
red handkerchief, to keep it on&mdash;stood ready to depart,
wiping the tears from his eyes, first with the cuff of one
sleeve, and then with the other.
</p>

<p>
Willard cast one look at Christie, who had sunk on the
floor, her face hidden in her lap; and then turned to depart,
followed by the unwilling Carl.  The blinding gust of
wind and rain that met them in the face nearly drove them
back; but, bending to the storm, they resolutely plunged
on; and it required all the strength of Mrs. Tom to close
the door after them.
</p>

<p>
The storm seemed increasing in fury.  The wind
howled, raged and shrieked; the waves thundered with
terrific force over the rocks; the thunder roared, peal upon
peal, shaking the very island to its center; the lightning
alone lit up for an instant, with its blue, livid glare, the
pitchy darkness; and then the crash of the strong trees in
the neighboring forest, as they were violently torn up by
the roots, all mingled together in awful discord.
</p>

<p>
But, above all, the minute-gun came wailing once
more over the sea.
</p>

<p>
The two, plunging so blindly through the storm,
hastened on as if winged at the saddest of sounds.  And,
after tumbling, slipping, falling, rising, and hurrying on
again, they reached the old lodge at last.
</p>

<p>
A light was burning in the kitchen.  Both rushed in
there&mdash;wet, dripping, and half-blinded by the storm.
Aunt Moll was on her knees in the middle of the floor
rocking back and forward, and praying aloud in an agony
of terror and apprehension; and Lem was walking up
and down, groaning and praying, at intervals, with his
mother.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, good Lor'!  I's been a drefful sinner, I is; but if
you'll only spare me jes' a little while longer, I tends to
do better.  Oh, do spare me!  I ain't ready to go 'deed and
'deed I ain't.  Please do, good Lor', an' I'll nebber do
nothin' sinful again.  Oh, what a streak o' lightnin' dat
'ar was!  O, Lemuel, kneel down, or yer ole mammy'll
be took away in a flash o' lightnin' like 'Lijah was."
</p>

<p>
And in an agony of fear Lem tramped up and down
the long kitchen, quaking at every fresh clap of thunder.
</p>

<p>
"Come, cease that caterwauling!" said Drummond, as
he burst in upon them, dripping like a sea-god; "and
you, Lem, get your coat, and come with us down to the
beach, and see if we cannot save some poor unfortunates
from death and destruction."
</p>

<p>
"'Deed, Master Drummin', honey, I dassent, I's 'feared
to go out," said Lem, his teeth chattering like a pair of
castanets.
</p>

<p>
"You black villain, if you are not ready in ten minutes,
I'll thrash you till you are not able to stir!"
exclaimed Willard, catching and shaking him furiously.
</p>

<p>
Too terrified by the young man's fierce tone to resist,
Lem drew on his hat and coat, and, shaking like one in
an ague-fit, followed them out into the night, and
darkness, and storm.
</p>

<p>
Once more over the tempest-tossed waves rolled the
mournful voice of the minute-gun, like a dying cry.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Heaven, this is maddening!" exclaimed Willard,
rushing to the beach like one demented; "to think they
should perish thus, within reach of us almost, while we
are here in safety.  Carl, where is your boat?  I will
venture out, and see if I cannot save some one, at least."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Marse Drummin'! for de dear Lord's sake, don't
risk it!" cried Lem, in an agony of terror.  "No boat
could live two minutes in dem waves."
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't launch the boat in these breakers," said
Carl, "much less pull, if you were into her."
</p>

<p>
"And they must perish before our very eyes!  Oh,
heavens, this is awful!"
</p>

<p>
Again he listened for the gun, but it came no more.
Its voice was silenced in storm and death.
</p>

<p>
"They have gone down!" said Carl; "the signal gun
will fire no more."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven have mercy on their souls!" said Willard,
solemnly, lifting his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Amen!" said Lem, whose fears seemed swallowed
up in awe.
</p>

<p>
"We may soon look out for the bodies," said Carl,
straining his eyes over the black, seething waves.
</p>

<p>
Even as he spoke, by the blinding light of a glare of
lightning they beheld two bodies, lashed to a spar, thrown
violently on the sands near them.  All sprang forward,
and drew them up beyond the reach of the waves.
</p>

<p>
"Unfasten this rope," said Carl, "and we will bring
them up to the house.  Perhaps they may not be drowned
yet."
</p>

<p>
"One's a woman," said Lem, as he cut the lashing.
"I can carry her, I reckon, while you two tote the man
along."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, then," said Willard, "up to Mrs. Tom's.  Be
quick!"
</p>

<p>
Bearing, with the utmost difficulty, their wet and apparently
lifeless burdens in their arms, they reached the cottage
of the widow, and deposited the senseless forms
before the fire.  Then, leaving them to her charge and that
of Christie, they descended once more to the beach to
rescue any other unfortunate who might providentially be
washed ashore.
</p>

<p>
Toward midnight the storm abated, and the king of
the tempest sullenly began to call off his hosts.  The dense
thick clouds slowly rolled back, the lightning ceased to
flash, and the thunder only growled in the distance.  The
wind abated, and the rain fell more slowly; but, though
they waited until morning dawned, no more bodies were
wafted to their feet.
</p>

<p>
The next day's light showed a scene of ruin and death.
The beach was strewn in every direction with fragments
of the broken ship, and some half-dozen dead bodies lay
scattered on the sands.  All were cold and dead; and sad
and disappointed, our tired and drenched watchers turned
a way.
</p>

<p>
Before going to the lodge Willard visited the cottage,
and learned that the rescued ones were both alive, and
might recover.  And, grateful to have been the means of
saving even two of the unfortunates, he sought his own
couch, to dream of wrecks and drowned men till noon-day.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
SIBYL'S RETURN TO THE ISLE
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "There is a shadow in her eye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A languor in her frame;<br>
  Yet rouse her spirit and she'll glow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With passion's fiercest flame."&mdash;T.W.H.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was late in the afternoon of the following day when
Willard Drummond left the lodge for Mrs. Tom's
cottage.  Curiosity to see the rescued ones prompted
the visit as much as any other feeling; and he walked
along rapidly, viewing the scene of desolation which the
preceding night's tempest had left.
</p>

<p>
The cottage door was open to admit the pleasant
sunshine, and Willard paused for a moment to view the scene
before he entered.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom went bustling about the room in her usual
breezy, chirruping way, talking incessantly, but in a
subdued tone, as though afraid of disturbing some one.
Christie sat near the window, bending over her sewing,
looking pale still, after the terror and excitement of the
previous night.  But Willard's eyes did not linger a
moment on her; they were fixed, as if fascinated, on
another, who lay back in Mrs. Tom's arm-chair, propped
up with pillows.
</p>

<p>
It was the woman, or rather the girl, he had saved,
What was there in that pale young face to make him
start so vehemently, while the blood rushed in a crimson
torrent to his very temples?  He only saw a small, slight
figure; short, crisp, golden curls clustering over a round,
white, polished forehead; bright, saucy gray eyes, half
veiled now under the long, silken eyelashes, resting on the
pearly cheek; a little rosebud mouth, and a nose decidedly
<i>retrousse</i>.  It was not a wonderfully pretty face;
but there was something bright, piquant, original, and
charming about it&mdash;something daring, defiant, and
high-spirited, as you could see even in its pallor and languor.
She might have been sixteen, though she scarcely looked
so old as that.
</p>

<p>
She lay back now with her little white hands folded
listlessly on her lap, her veiled eyes fixed upon them with
a dreamy, abstracted look, as of one whose thoughts are
far away&mdash;replying low and languidly to Mrs. Tom's
ceaseless questioning.  And Willard Drummond, pale
and excited, leaned against the door-post, gazing upon
her like one who cannot believe his senses.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Christie raised her eyes from her work, and
uttered an ejaculation as she espied him.  He could
linger no longer, and like one who walks in his sleep, he
passed in.
</p>

<p>
The clear, dark eyes of the little lady in the chair were
raised as he entered, and fixed with a look of complete
amazement on his face.  Her dark eyes dilated&mdash;her lips
parted in surprise, as she made an effort to rise from her
chair, and then sank back exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"Willard Drummond!" broke in surprise from her
lips.
</p>

<p>
"Laura!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
And he was by her side in an instant, holding her
hands in his, and gazing in her eyes with a look that
would have aroused Sibyl's jealousy, had she been
present, but which only puzzled Christie, who, with
Mrs. Tom, looked on in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Who in the world would have expected to meet you
here!" said the lady, recovering first from a moment's
embarrassed silence; "certainly the last spot on earth I
should ever look for the gay, pleasure-loving Willard
Drummond.  So, sir, I presume you have been 'taking
the world easy,' here in this Enchanted Isle, while your
poor, deluded friends were laboring under the conviction
you were improving your mind&mdash;-which needed improving,
goodness knows&mdash;by foreign travel?  Pretty
conduct, Mr. Drummond, I must say!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Laura!  Laura! how little did I dream, last
night, you were in that fatal ship!" he exclaimed,
passionately.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh! yes; wasn't it awful?" said the young girl,
with a shudder.  "I'll never get the horrid sight and
sounds of that dreadful night out of my mind while I
live.  Oh! to have heard the screams, and cries, and
prayers, and blasphemies of the drowning crew, mingling
with the fearful storm, was appalling.  Holy saints!  I
hear them yet!"
</p>

<p>
With a convulsive shudder, she hid her face in her
hands.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven your life was saved, at least," said
Drummond, with fervor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, our escape was little less than miraculous.  I
remember some one making me fast to a floating spar, as
the ship struck; then the waves swept furiously over me,
and I remember no more, until I awoke and found kind
friends chafing my hands and temples.  Was it you who
saved me, Willard?"
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly.  The waves washed you ashore, and
my part of it was merely to have you conveyed up here.
But how little did I dream then, that Laura Britton was
so near!"
</p>

<p>
"Laura Courtney, if you please, Mr. Drummond," she
said, quietly.  "I have had the honor of changing my
name since I saw you last."
</p>

<p>
"And you <i>have</i> married Edgar Courtney!  Oh, Laura,
Laura?" he said, reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes flashed as she faced suddenly round, and
said, sharply:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have married him; and, Mr. Drummond,
don't you dare to speak of him in that tone again.  I will
not endure it.  No, not if you had saved my life a dozen
times."
</p>

<p>
The angry blood flushed to her pale cheek, and she
jerked her hand angrily away from his grasp.
</p>

<p>
Willard bit his lip till it bled, to keep down his rising
anger; while Christie and Mrs. Tom still sat staring in
increasing amazement.
</p>

<p>
There was a long, disagreeable pause, broken at last
by Mrs. Courtney saying, in her usual quick, abrupt
way:
</p>

<p>
"There! you need not get mad, now, Willard; have
you forgotten that no one used ever to get angry at
anything said by 'Madcap Laura?'  Come, don't speak so of
Mr. Courtney again, and I'll forgive you; there's my hand
on it.  I cannot forget that we are old friends."
</p>

<p>
A shadow crossed Willard's face, as he bent over the
little hand she extended.
</p>

<p>
"Has your&mdash;has Mr. Courtney been saved?" he asked,
in a subdued tone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the waves washed us ashore together, but something
struck him on the head, and he is unable to rise.  I
suppose you are puzzling your brains now to know what
brought us to this quarter of the globe?"
</p>

<p>
"I confess I have some curiosity on that point."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see," said little Mrs. Courtney, adjusting
herself more comfortably in her chair, "we went on a
bridal-tour to New York, and on our way home Edgar
thought he would call at Westport, where he had business
of some kind.  All the way we had fine weather until the
journey was at its end, and then the storm arose in which
we nearly perished.  But, Willard, what under the sun
can have driven you here?"
</p>

<p>
Willard colored as he met her keen, bright glance.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I came with a friend of mine, a certain Captain
Campbell, who owns a residence here, and I am for the
present his guest, though unexpected business, for a time,
called him away.  Anything for a change, you know," he
added, laughing, "and this island is not <i>quite</i> devoid of
attraction."
</p>

<p>
"By no means," said Mrs. Courtney, glancing
demurely at Christie.  "I certainly admire your good taste
in saying so.  Once here, with such a divinity as this, I
can easily account for the attraction that binds you, most
fickle of men, here," she added, in a lower tone.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw, Laura!" he said, striving to hide by a laugh
the guilty flush that lingered still on his face, "you surely
do not think I have forgotten <i>you</i> so soon?"
</p>

<p>
"If it were any one else I would not, but you&mdash;oh, you
never would be true to any one longer than a month.
Talk about woman's fickleness!  I'm sure the wind never
was half so changeable as you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you gave me great encouragement to be true to
you," he answered, with some bitterness.
</p>

<p>
"Did I," said Mrs. Courtney, with a yawn.  "Well, I
know I was a horrid little simpleton once, but I've grown
old and wise now.  And, if it's all the same to you,
Mr. Drummond, I'll leave you now.  I feel tired and half sick
yet, after last night."
</p>

<p>
She rose and went into the room with a weary, tired
air.
</p>

<p>
"So, you know her?" said Mrs. Tom.  "Who'd ever
thought it?  So that tall, dark-looking fellow, with all the
whiskers and mustaches, is her husband?  I declare if it
ain't scandalous the way gals <i>will</i> get married afore
they're out o' short frocks.  I jist wish I had a darter&mdash;no,
I mean if I <i>had</i> a darter&mdash;I'd like to see her tryin' to get
married at such an unchristian age!"
</p>

<p>
Christie turned scarlet, and bent lower over her work.
</p>

<p>
Willard stood leaning with one arm on the mantel-piece,
gazing thoughtfully into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"What did you say her name was?" inquired Mrs. Tom,
sitting down, and beginning to reel off yarn.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Edgar Courtney, now; she was Laura Britton
when I last met her," he said, as if half speaking to
himself.
</p>

<p>
"S'pose you've known her a long time?" continued
Mrs. Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we were children together," he replied, in the
same dreamy tone.
</p>

<p>
"And her husband&mdash;known him long?" pursued Mrs. Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know him for a cruel, jealous, passionate
tyrant!" said Willard, starting up so suddenly and
fiercely that Mrs. Tom dropped the ball she was winding,
and sprang back.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you needn't make such a fuss about it!" she
exclaimed, recovering herself, and indignantly resuming
her work.  "Scaring a body out o' their wits for nothin'.
I s'pose she knowed all that afore she took him."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, pardon my vehemence, Mrs. Tom," said Willard,
recovering himself by an effort, as he saw Christie's
troubled gaze fixed on his face; "I forgot myself for a
moment.  But this patient of yours, this Mr. Courtney,
may need a doctor.  I am going over to Westport
to-night, and if you wish, I will bring one to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"It would be better," said Mrs. Tom, thoughtfully.
"He's got a temenjous cut right in his head.  I did what
I could for him; but, of course, a body would feel more
satisfied if they had a reg'lar doctor.'
</p>

<p>
"If I were ill, Mrs. Tom, I should trust to you in
preference to any doctor ever warranted to kill or cure," said
Willard, as he took his hat to go.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom smiled benignly at the compliment, quite
delighted at this tacit acknowledgment of her skill.
</p>

<p>
And an hour after, Willard and Lem were on their
way to Westport.
</p>

<p>
What were Willard Drummond's thoughts, as, sitting
silently in the stern of the boat, he watched the dancing
waves flash and sparkle in the sunlight?  Very different
from those he had indulged not long since, when, on one
eventful night, he and Christie had crossed it together.
This Laura Courtney, with her pretty, piquant face, and
pert, saucy manners, had first won his boyish heart.  He
had raved, and vowed, and implored at her feet, but she
only laughed at him and his passion, and now she had no
more power over his heart than if she never existed.
Might it not be the same with those he had loved since?
Was not his passion for Christie beginning to grow cold
already?  Would it not grow colder every day?  And in
the hot ardor of his love he had made this little obscure,
uneducated, shy child, his wife.  Why, oh, why, had he
not waited?  And now that the deed was irreparable,
where was this to end?
</p>

<p>
They reached Westport before dark; and Lem, having
landed him, set off for the island again, promising to
return for him in the morning.  The moon was just rising
above the pine trees when he reached home; and, on
entering the house, the first object he beheld was his
young mistress, in close conversation with his mother.
</p>

<p>
"Lor' sakes, Miss Sibyl! you here!" was Lem's first
ejaculation.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Lem; and glad to be home again," she answered,
gayly.  "Aunt Moll tells me you have just been taking
Mr. Drummond over to Westport."
</p>

<p>
"So I hev; but I'm to go for him early to-morrow-mornin.'
'Spect, ef he'd know you was a comin,' he'd
staid here."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" said Aunt Moll, dubiously.
</p>

<p>
"Did he seem lonely during my&mdash;during our absence?"
asked Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
"Lonesome?  'Deed he didn't, honey; he was in fust
rate spirits all the time."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Sibyl, a shadow falling over her face; "he
spent his time in fishing and shooting, I suppose, and
snaring birds?"
</p>

<p>
"Snarin' birds?  Yes; an' caught one, too," said Aunt
Moll, in a tone that spoke volumes.
</p>

<p>
"Caught <i>one</i>!  What do you mean, Aunt Moll?  I
don't understand," said Sibyl, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl, don't listen to her.  She's allers got some
nonsense to tell," interrupted Lem, casting an angry and
warning glance toward his mother.
</p>

<p>
But now that the opportunity she had so long waited
for had come, the old woman's tongue was not to be
stopped.
</p>

<p>
"It's all fur yer good, child, 'deed it is; an' I 'siders it
my duty to warn you, honey, dat Massa Drummond ain't
to be 'pended on.  Dar!"
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Moll, what do you mean?  Speak, and tell me
what you are hinting at.  What has Mr. Drummond
done?" asked Sibyl, growing very pale.
</p>

<p>
"Well, chile, 'stead o' stayin' here, and thinking ob
you, as he'd orter, he's been prowlin', all hours o' de
night, round de island, wid dat 'ar Miss Chrissy&mdash;making
lub to her, I'll be bound."
</p>

<p>
"<i>What?</i>" cried Sibyl, in a tone that made the old
woman leap to her feet, as she sprang forward, and caught
her by the arm.  "Dare you insinuate such a thing?  I
tell you he could not, and he would not&mdash;he dare not prove
false to me!"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl, honey! for de Lord's sake, don't look at
me wid such wild eyes.  I 'spec's she's witched him.  I
can't 'count for it no other way," said Aunt Moll,
trembling before the awful wrath of those blazing eyes.  "I
on'y says what I knows.  He's all the time talkin' 'bout
her to hisself, when he's 'lone."
</p>

<p>
"It cannot be true; he dare not deceive me!" almost
shrieked Sibyl.  "What proof have you of this?
Speak! speak!"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl, honey! you may 'sassinate me ef you's a
mind to; but I's tellin' de trufe.  Sence eber you left,
dey ain't a minute apart.  Dey've sailed in de riber after
night, an' gone trampin' in de woods in de day time; an'
I's heered him callin' her his 'dear Chrissy,' when he's
'lone.  I knows, chile, 'taint pleasant, nor likewise
'greeable for you to hear dis; but I talks for your good,
honey&mdash;'deed I does."
</p>

<p>
But now the first fierce gust of passion was over, and
pale and tottering, Sibyl leaned against the
chimney-piece&mdash;her arm on the mantel, her head bowed upon it,
shuddering, sinking, collapsed.  All his neglect, that had
puzzled her so long, was accounted for now.  She was
forgotten&mdash;deserted, for this island girl!
</p>

<p>
So long she remained in that fixed, rigid attitude, that
Aunt Moll began to grow alarmed; and she was on the
point of commencing a consoling speech, beginning with:
"Miss Sibyl, honey," when the young girl lifted her head,
and, asked in a hollow voice:
</p>

<p>
"Is this&mdash;this girl on the island still?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, chile, ob course she is&mdash;down to Miss Tom's."
</p>

<p>
For a moment longer Sibyl stood, gazing steadily
before her, with those wild, fierce, burning eyes; her face
perfectly colorless, save that two dark-purple spots blazed
in and out upon it like burning coals; her teeth set; her
hands clenched.  All the humiliation, the shame, the
agony of being deserted, rushed, like a burning torrent,
through her mind.  And with it came a fierce, demoniacal
hatred of her idol, and a deadly wish to be revenged.
</p>

<p>
Starting suddenly up, she fled up the stairs, through
the long, unlighted hall, out of the front door, and took
the path leading to Mrs. Tom's.
</p>

<p>
The bright moonlight lit all around with a pale,
radiant glory.  And, standing near a rock, commanding
an extensive view of the sea, Christie stood, enjoying the
beauty of the night, when suddenly a fierce grasp was
laid on her shoulder, and she looked up.  Her vision was
realized.  Sibyl Campbell stood glaring upon her, with
her fierce, wild, black eyes, her long hair streaming down
her back, like an aroused tigress preparing to spring.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
THE MEETING.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Thou mayest hold a serpent by the tongue,<br>
  A chafed lion by the mortal paw,<br>
  A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,<br>
  Than cross this love of mine."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Trembling, paralyzed, shrinking with terror and
superstitious awe, as she recollected her vision,
Christie stood quailing before that dark,
passionate glance.
</p>

<p>
And, glaring upon her with a hatred and jealousy that
for the time "swept her soul in tempests," and inspired
her with a momentary frenzy, Sibyl stood, transfixing her
with those wild, fierce eyes.  With one glance she took
in all her rival's extraordinary beauty, far surpassing even
what she feared; and the sight, to her passionate heart,
was like oil poured upon flame.
</p>

<p>
"So," she hissed, at length, through her closed teeth,
"pretty Miss Christie has found a lover during my
absence.  Girl, take care!  You have begun a dangerous
game, but the end has not come!"
</p>

<p>
Her words broke the spell of terror that held Christie
dumb.  And now, noticing her disordered attire, and wild,
disheveled hair, she said, in surprise and entreaty:
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl, what has happened?  What have I done?
I did not know you were on the island."
</p>

<p>
"No; I am aware of that," said Sibyl, with a hard, bitter
laugh.  "Oh, it is a wondrous pity I should have come
so soon to spoil the sport!  You and your dainty lover
thought yourselves secure&mdash;thought Sibyl Campbell far
away.  But again I say to you, beware! for 'twere better
for you to tamper with a lioness robbed of her young
than with the passions of this beating, throbbing heart!"
</p>

<p>
She looked like some priestess of doom denouncing
all mankind as she stood there, with her long, black,
streaming hair, her wild, burning, passionate eyes, her
face white, rigid, and ghastly, save where the two purple
spots still blazed in and out on either cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Miss Sibyl&mdash;dear Miss Sibyl! what have I done?
Oh, I never, <i>never</i> meant to offend you, or stand in your
path; as Heaven hears me, I did not!  Tell me, only tell
me in what I have offended, and I will never do it again,"
said Christie, clasping her hands in increasing terror and
childlike simplicity.
</p>

<p>
"What have you done?  Have you really the effrontery
to stand there and ask me such a question?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl, I do not know&mdash;indeed, indeed, I do not
know!" exclaimed Christie, earnestly.
</p>

<p>
In all the storm of anger and jealousy that raged in her
soul, a look of superb scorn curled the lips of Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
"You do not know!  Oh, wondrous innocence! angelic
simplicity!  Must I despise as well as hate you?  Listen,
then, since I must speak my shame, and answer me truly,
as you hope for salvation.  Promise."
</p>

<p>
"I promise!"
</p>

<p>
"Swear to answer me truly, by all you hold dear on
earth! by your hopes of heaven!"
</p>

<p>
"I swear!  Oh, Sibyl, speak!" cried Christie, wrought
up to an agony of terror and excitement by her wild
words.
</p>

<p>
"Then, and may Heaven's heaviest curse fall upon him
if I conjecture truly&mdash;has Willard Drummond dared to
speak of love to you?"
</p>

<p>
Pale, trembling, terror-stricken, Christie's tongue clove
to the roof of her mouth; had her life depended on it, no
sound could have escaped her quivering lips.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, and tell me!  Speak, for I must know&mdash;I
have a right to know?" cried Sibyl, grasping her arm, and
setting her teeth hard to keep down the tempest of
passion that was sweeping through her soul.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, spare me&mdash;spare me!" wailed Christie, lifting
up her pleading hands.
</p>

<p>
"Death, girl!  Must I tear the truth from your false
heart!  Tell me, truly, has he dared to speak of love,
and have you dared to listen to him?  Heavens! will
you speak before I am tempted to murder you!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do not ask me&mdash;do not ask me!" cried Christie,
in a dying voice, as trembling, fainting, she sank at the
feet of her terrible foe.
</p>

<p>
With her hands clenched until the nails sank into the
quivering flesh, her teeth set hard, her deep, labored
breathing, her passion-convulsed face, she looked more
like an enraged pythoness than a frail girl learning for
the first time her lover's infidelity.
</p>

<p>
She required no further proof now.  He whom she
would have trusted with her soul's salvation was false.
And, oh! what is there more terrible in this world than
to learn that one whom we love and trust has proven
untrue?
</p>

<p>
Sibyl had loved as she had done everything else&mdash;madly;
had trusted blindly; had worshipped idolatrously,
adoring man instead of God; and now this awakening
was doubly terrible.  Had Christie been in her place, she
would have wept and sobbed in the utter abandon of
sorrow; but her grief would have been nothing compared
with the dry, burning despair in those wild black eyes.
</p>

<p>
Now that Sibyl had learned the worst, her fiery,
tempestuous fierceness passed away, and there fell a great
calm&mdash;a calm all the more terrific after her late storm of
passion.
</p>

<p>
"And so I am forsaken," she said, in a deep, hollow
voice, "and for her&mdash;this pretty, blue-eyed baby.  I, whom
he promised to love through life and beyond death.
Saints in heaven! shall he do this and live?"
</p>

<p>
"You?" said Christie, lifting her pale, terrified face.
"And did he promise to love you, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, learn it, and let it whelm your soul in shame.
Before he saw you, before he knew you, he loved me;
and I was to be his wife.  Yes, weep, and wail, and sob;
your tears shall not soon dry.  You have caused him to
forget his vows, his honor, his plighted faith, his
promised love to me, and you must pay the penalty."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I never knew it&mdash;I never knew it!" wailed
Christie, wringing her hands.
</p>

<p>
"And, as he has been false to me, so, likewise, will he
be false you.  You are the cause of his treachery, of his
broken vows, his perjured soul; you are the cause of all;
and, think you such love can be blessed?"
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me!  Oh, Sibyl, forgive me!" still wailed
Christie.
</p>

<p>
"May Heaven never forgive me if I do!" cried Sibyl,
with impassioned vehemence.  "Think you, girl, I am
one to be won by tears and protestations?  Faugh! you
should have thought of all this when you listened to
his unlawful love."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I did not know!  As Heaven hears me, I did
not know.  I would have died sooner than have listened
to him, had I known!"
</p>

<p>
"Prove it," said Sibyl, with a sudden gleam in her
dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;how?  Only say how I shall redeem my
error!  Let me know how I may atone!"
</p>

<p>
"Atone!&mdash;you?", said Sibyl, with a withering sneer.
"I tell you, girl, if your life could be prolonged for a
thousand years, and every second of that time spent in
torture, you could not atone for the wrong you have done
me.  But make such expiation as you can&mdash;prove at
least that there is some truth in your words."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Sibyl, I would willingly die if I could redeem
my fault."
</p>

<p>
"Your death would not redeem it.  What is your
paltry life to me?  Neither do I require it&mdash;the sacrifice
I would have you make is easier.  Give him up!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! anything but that!  Sibyl, that is worse than
death!" said the stricken child-bride, in a fainting voice.
</p>

<p>
"Did you not say you would atone?  Prove it now&mdash;give
him up&mdash;it is my right, and I demand it.  Promise."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I cannot!&mdash;I cannot!" moaned Christie, shrinking
down, as though she would never rise again.
</p>

<p>
"And this is your repentance&mdash;this, your atonement
for what you have done?" said Sibyl, stepping back, and
regarding her with superb scorn.  "This, then, is the end
of all your fine promises.  Girl, I tell you, you dare not;
it is at your peril you see him more.  My claim is
above yours.  I warn, I insist, I demand you to give him
up.  It is my right, and you shall do it.  What are you,
little reptile, that you should stand in the path of Sibyl
Campbell?"
</p>

<p>
"I am his wife!" arose to the lips of Christie.  That
little sentence she well knew would have silenced Sibyl's
claim forever, but she remembered her promise in time,
and was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Rise, girl, don't cower there at my feet," said Sibyl,
stepping back in bitter contempt.  "It is your place, it
is true; but his love has ennobled you, since it has raised
you to the rank of my rival.  Am I to understand you
promise your intimacy with him is at an end?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl, I cannot.  I love him!"  And pale and
sad, Christie rose and stood before her.
</p>

<p>
The blaze, the dark, scorching, flaming glance from
those eyes of fire might have killed her.
</p>

<p>
"And you dare utter this to me?" she said, or rather
hissed, through her tightly clenched teeth.  "Audacious
girl, do you not fear that I will strike you dead where
you stand?"
</p>

<p>
Again Christie thought of her vision, and trembling,
terrified, fainting, she clung to a rock for support, unable
to speak.  With all the fiery, long-slumbering passion of
her lion-heart aroused, the fierce, dark girl before her
looked desperate enough for anything.
</p>

<p>
"Promise!" she said, in a hollow voice, coming nearer,
and raising her arm threateningly.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot!  Oh, Miss Sibyl, I cannot!" faltered the
almost fainting Christie.
</p>

<p>
"Promise!" again cried Sibyl, glaring upon her with
her wild, dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot!" still wailed Christie, pressing her hand
over her heart.
</p>

<p>
"Promise, or die!" exclaimed the mad girl, grasping
her by the arm in a vise-like grip.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot&mdash;I would sooner die!" said Christie, as,
unable to stand, she again sank at the feet of her
vindictive foe.
</p>

<p>
For a moment it seemed as though the threat would
be accomplished, as Sibyl stood over her like one turned
to stone.  But the next instant releasing her hold, she
hurled her from her; and, as if fleeing from temptation,
fled down the rocks, over the rough path toward the
lodge, and sank fainting and exhausted on the
sitting-room floor.
</p>

<p>
An hour later Aunt Moll entered, and beholding Sibyl,
with her streaming hair, lying prone on the floor, grew
alarmed, and coming over, she shook her gently, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl, is yer sick?  Come, git up now, like a
good chile, 'fore you catch your def o' cold, a lyin' on de
bare floor.  'Deed, honey, 'taint right for young people to
heave derselves into de draft, dis way."
</p>

<p>
But Aunt Moll went through all the phases of the
potential mood&mdash;"commanding, exhorting"&mdash;in vain.
Her young mistress neither moved nor stirred.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Miss Sibyl, do get up&mdash;please do.  De Lord
knows I's 'fraid you'll cotch de rheumatiz in yer bones.
Most oncomfortablest thing as ever was; 'specially fore a
rain storm, when ebery j'int feels as if dere was forty
hundred cross-cut saws a going t'rough it.  Come,
chile&mdash;come, git up, an' let yer ole mammy ondress you, an' put
yer to bed."
</p>

<p>
And Aunt Moll shook the supposed sleeper gently.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl lifted her head, and half rose, disclosing a face
so pale and haggard, a form so sunken and collapsed, that
Aunt Moll started back in terror.
</p>

<p>
"What on airth de matter in you, Miss Sibyl?  I 'clare
to man, if yer ain't almost skeered me out o' my wits, sure
'nuff!  Is you sick, chile?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sick at heart!&mdash;sick at heart!" said Sibyl, in a
despairing voice.
</p>

<p>
"I knowed sumfin' was de matter wid yer.  Well, git
up like a good chile, and let me git some catnip tea for
you, it's the best cure in the world for sich complaints."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Aunt Moll, leave me.  My illness is beyond your
art.  'Not poppy nor mandragora can ever medicine me
to that sweet sleep' I once slept beneath this roof."
</p>

<p>
"Now, chile, don't say so," said Aunt Moll, touched
by her hopeless tone.  "Folks ain't tuk so sudden as all
dat, you know.  I ain't got no poppy nor man dragoon;
but catnip tea is jes' as good, cordin' to my way o'
thinkin'.  An' when you take a good night's res', you'll be all
well in de mornin'&mdash;please de Lor'."
</p>

<p>
"Rest!  Rest!  When shall I rest again?  Aunt Moll,
leave me.  I want to be alone."
</p>

<p>
"'Deed, Miss Sibyl, I darsent do it&mdash;'twon't do to
leab you here in de draf, all alone.  Let me help you to
bed, an' make de catnip tea, an' you'll be better
to-morrow, sure."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this heart&mdash;this heart!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, chile, I knows; I 'spects it's de cramps you'se
got, an' I 'vises of you to get up.  Come, honey,
come."  And Aunt Moll put her arm coaxingly round her young
lady's neck, and attempted to lift her up.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Aunt Moll! if you only knew my affliction!
What matters it whether I die or not, since I have
nothing more to live for?  I might as well die now as live;
for the living death of a loveless life."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't talk so, Miss Sibyl; 'taint right, nor
likewise 'spectful to de Lord, who sends us cramps, as
well as healf, sometimes.  'Tis r'ally 'stonishin', de way
you takes on 'bout it."
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Moll, I am not bodily ill&mdash;only wronged, suffering,
despairing, deceived, broken-hearted almost," said
Sibyl, looking straight before her, with a fixed, anguished
look.
</p>

<p>
"Dear heart! don't take on so about it.  I's real sorry,
I is."
</p>

<p>
And good Aunt Moll passed her hand gently and
caressingly over the glossy, dark locks of the young
girl.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! there is nothing but falsehood and treachery in
this world!  I, who loved and trusted so much, to be
now deceived!  I would have staked my life, my soul,
my hopes of heaven on his fidelity!  And now, this
awakening from my blissful, delusive dream is worse
than death.  Oh, Aunt Moll! my dear old friend, is there
any one who really loves me in this world but you?"
</p>

<p>
And, wholly overcome, Sibyl's strong despair gave way
to a passionate burst of tears.
</p>

<p>
Since Sibyl had been a child, Aunt Moll never remembered
to have seen her weep before; and now, in her
quaint, tender manner, she strove to soothe her grief.
But still the young girl wept and sobbed with wild
vehemence, until nature was relieved; and she looked up,
calmer and far less despairing than before.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Moll," she said, suddenly, "what time does Lem
go over to Westport to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Before noon, honey."
</p>

<p>
"Then tell him to be ready to take me to N&mdash;&mdash; before
he goes for <i>him</i>!  And now, Aunt Moll, I will follow
your advice, and retire."
</p>

<p>
"But won't you take the catnip tea, chile?" persisted
the old woman, who had some vague idea of the
all-powerful virtues of the herb.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, thank you, I do not need it."
</p>

<p>
"But it'll do you good, chile; you'll feel more
comfortable for it."
</p>

<p>
"Comfort! comfort!  Can anything ever restore comfort
here?"  And she struck her breast with her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, honey, de catnip tea."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, Aunt Moll."  And Sibyl flitted, like a
shadow, up the long staircase, and disappeared in the
gloom beyond.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
JEALOUSY.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;"Trifles, light as air,<br>
  Are to the jealous confirmation strong<br>
  As proofs of holy writ.&mdash;OTHELLO.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The next morning, Sibyl made her appearance in
the sitting-room, pale, wan, and haggard, as
though she had spent a sleepless night.  But she
appeared calm.  Whatever course she had determined to
pursue, seemed fully settled, and now she was calm; but
it was like the calmness of a sleeping volcano, from which
fire and flame, hurling destruction on all, might at any
moment burst forth.
</p>

<p>
Answering gravely all Aunt Moll's anxious inquiries
after her health, she seated herself at the breakfast-table,
but touched nothing, save a cup of hot coffee.  And, after
this slight refreshment, she put on her hat and mantle
and descended to the beach, where Lem, with the boat,
was already awaiting her coming.
</p>

<p>
Seating herself, she wrapped her mantle closely
around her, and fixing her eyes steadily on the dancing
waves, the journey was performed in stern silence.  Two
hours brought them to N&mdash;&mdash;, and, leaving her there, Lem
set out for Westport to meet Drummond.  Arrived there,
he found that young gentleman, accompanied by Captain
Campbell and a florid, bald-headed, old man, who proved
to be the surgeon.
</p>

<p>
On their way, Willard explained to them how the
wounded man and his wife had been saved from the
wreck.  And when they reached the island, Captain
Campbell, unconscious that his sister was gone, hastened
to the lodge, while Willard accompanied the surgeon to
the cottage of Mrs. Tom.
</p>

<p>
As they entered, Christie, who in spite of her hidden
grief, was busily employed as usual, looked hastily up,
and turned, if possible, a shade paler than before.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Courtney sat listlessly turning over the leaves of
a novel, with a bored look on her pretty face; while
opposite her, supported by pillows, on Mrs. Tom's
wooden sofa, lay her wounded husband, whose eyes never
for a moment, wandered from her face.
</p>

<p>
He was a man of thirty, at least, and would have been
handsome but for his ghastly pallor and a certain sour,
querulous, suspicious expression his face were.  His
complexion, naturally dark, had faded to a sickly yellow,
looking almost white in contrast with his black hair, and
thick, black whiskers and mustache.  But it was the
expression of his face that was particularly unprepossessing&mdash;in
the thin, compressed lips, and watchful, cunning
eyes you could read suspicion, distrust, and doubt.  Two
things would have struck you instantly, had you seen
him sitting there&mdash;one, was his passionate love for his
wife; the other, a slumbering fire of jealousy, that the
faintest breath might have fanned into a never-dying
flame.
</p>

<p>
They formed a striking contrast as they sat there&mdash;she
so pretty, careless, saucy, and indifferent; he so
haggard with illness, and with that watchful, distrustful
look on his face.  And yet, it had been a love-match;
he loved her to idolatry, and she, rejecting perhaps
worthier suitors, at the age of sixteen had run away from
school and eloped with Edgar Courtney.  Willard
Drummond had been among the rejected ones.  Before the
honey-moon was over, the wild girl had found she had
married a jealous, exacting tyrant, who hated every man
on whom she smiled, and would have kept her locked up,
where no eye but his own could ever rest upon her, had
he dared.
</p>

<p>
At first little Laura submitted to his caprices, because
she loved him, or thought she did; but as he grew more
and more exacting, this love died wholly away, and the
little bride awoke one morning in dismay to find she had
made a life-long mistake.  Still, she was too good and
generous to strive to lay the blame on him for taking
advantage of her youth and romantic impulse to fly with
him, and would have laughed and danced on as merrily
as ever with him through life, without letting him know
it, had not his own conduct brought on the denouement.
</p>

<p>
He continued to be tyrannical.  Laura naturally
proud and high-spirited, grew at length very tired of his
absurd fancies and wishes, and vowed she would no
longer be a "meek, submissive wife."  But, though
inwardly despising him herself, she would allow no one
else to speak slightingly of him, as her first interview
with Willard Drummond proved.  And all the previous
night she had hovered over his bedside, anticipating his
every want with the most tender and vigilant care; and
it was only when, the next morning, he found himself
able to get up, that she had resumed her accustomed air
of careless indifference to himself and his wishes.  Had
he been more generous and less suspicious&mdash;had he had
faith in his young wife, she would have loved him and
been his alone; but had he really wished to make her
hate him, he could not have taken a surer plan to bring
such a result than the one he did.
</p>

<p>
All this long digression is necessary, that too much
blame may not be thrown upon the shoulders of the poor
little girl-bride for her reckless conduct and the awful
catastrophe that followed.
</p>

<p>
When Willard and the doctor entered, Christie, who
had anxiously waited for this opportunity, seeing
Mrs. Tom busily engaged, touched her husband on the arm,
and, whispering "Follow me," left the house.
</p>

<p>
He unhesitatingly obeyed, and overtook her near the
end of the garden, where, pale and troubled, she stood,
leaning against a tree.
</p>

<p>
"Weil, Christie, what is it?" he asked, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Willard," she said, lifting her reproachful eyes to his
face, "Sibyl Campbell was here last night!"
</p>

<p>
"Well!" he said, starting and coloring deeply.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! she told me all&mdash;how you had deceived
her, and deceived me!  Oh, Willard! how could you do so?"
</p>

<p>
"Deceived her?&mdash;deceived you?  I do not understand,
Christie," he said, coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! you do!  You promised to love only
her&mdash;to marry her; yet you deceived her, and married me!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, a moment ago, you said I deceived you likewise.
And how, I pray you, madam?  Go on," he said,
with a sneer.
</p>

<p>
"You made me your wife while pledged to another!"
</p>

<p>
"Which, doubtless, causes you a great deal of sorrow."
he said, in a tone of slight pique; for though his passion
for Christie was dying away, he could not endure the
thought, as yet, of her forgetting him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! you know being your wife is the greatest
happiness on earth for me; but when I saw her, last
night, so wild, passionate, and despairing, I felt as if I
could have died for very shame to think I had been the
cause of her misery!"
</p>

<p>
"Then she did seem despairing!" he said, while his
face flushed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes! almost crazed, mad, frenzied.  Her eyes
seemed killing me!"
</p>

<p>
"Who could have told her?&mdash;not you?" he exclaimed,
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no&mdash;no!  I do not know how she heard it; but
she knew all."
</p>

<p>
"What! our marriage, and all?" he cried, starting
up, and speaking in a tone that made Christie start back.
</p>

<p>
"No; she did not know that.  But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You did not dare to tell her?" he said, almost
threateningly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! why will you speak to me in that tone, dearest
Willard?  I did not mean to reproach you."
</p>

<p>
"It is very like it, however," he said bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"But may I not tell her, Willard?  She wanted me to
give you up; and I thought she would have killed me
because I refused.  I fear she may come again; and,
indeed, such another interview would kill me!  If she
knew all, she would desist.  Oh, Willard, dearest! will
you not tell her&mdash;or may I not tell her?"
</p>

<p>
"Not for the world&mdash;not for ten thousand worlds!
Would you ruin me, Christie?" he exclaimed,
impetuously.
</p>

<p>
"Ruin you, Willard?" she said, faintly.
</p>

<p>
"My worldly prospects, I mean.  My&mdash;oh, the thing
is impossible!" he said vehemently.  "I will not hear of
it for a moment."
</p>

<p>
"But you promised," she began, in a choking voice.
</p>

<p>
"And will keep that promise when the proper time
comes.  At present it is impossible&mdash;utterly impossible,
I tell you.  You must have faith in me, and wait, Christie."
</p>

<p>
Faith!  Was he worthy of it?  The thought arose in
the mind of Christie, to be instantly banished, as she
heroically kept back her rising tears and strove to say, in
a calm voice:
</p>

<p>
"Wait!  But for how long?  Willard, this secrecy is
dreadful! this deception weighs on my heart like lead!"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know; I cannot tell.  How often have I
said, when the <i>proper time</i> comes, when I may safely avow
it, all shall be revealed.  Christie, you are selfish&mdash;you
have no consideration for any one but yourself.  If I
loved you better than Miss Campbell, you should be the
last one to reproach me with it.  Take care that many
such scenes as this do not banish that love altogether."
</p>

<p>
His deeply offended tone sent the coldness of death to
the very heart of Christie.  She had not meant to anger
him; and now he was deeply displeased.  He had never
looked nor spoken to her so before.  And, totally
overcome, she covered her face with her hands and wept
aloud.
</p>

<p>
He was not proof against her tears.  All the old tenderness
returned at the sight, and, going over, he removed
her hands, saying, gently:
</p>

<p>
"My dearest love, forgive me, I was vexed, surprised,
grieved, and in the wrong.  Look up, little wife.  Lift
those blue eyes and say you forgive me!"
</p>

<p>
Before she could reply a footstep was heard approaching,
and she had only time to bestow on him one look of
love and pardon, and dart away, ere Captain Campbell
came in view.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Drummond, what says the doctor about your
patient?" he demanded, as he came up.
</p>

<p>
"I have not seen him since he went in.  But here he
comes, to answer for himself."
</p>

<p>
At this moment the doctor made his appearance, and
Willard propounded the inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's nothing serious, sir!  He'll be better in a
day or two," replied the doctor.  "Meantime, how am I
to get home?"
</p>

<p>
"My servant is down on the shore, waiting to take you
over," said Captain Campbell.
</p>

<p>
"I'll attend you down, doctor," said Willard, taking
the old gentleman's arm.
</p>

<p>
"And as I reign king, undisputed, here, I suppose it
will be only polite attention to visit my wounded
subject," said Captain Campbell, approaching the cottage.
</p>

<p>
On entering, he was presented by Mrs. Tom to her
guests.
</p>

<p>
Equally surprised and pleased to find so pretty and
piquant a little lady in Mrs. Courtney, the young captain
took a seat beside her, and entered, forthwith, into
conversation.  Mr. Courtney scowled at the handsome young
captain from under his black eyebrows, but said nothing.
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Courtney, mutually delighted by the agreeable
and gentlemanly newcomer, flung aside her novel,
forgot her <i>ennui</i>, and laughed and chatted with a volubility
that amazed and delighted her companion, who immediately
entered into a war of wit, words, and repartee,
during which the time sped rapidly away.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom was the only auditor, however, who seemed
in the least to enjoy their smart sayings, and sharp, witty
retorts; for Carl, under the unfailing eye of his aunt, was
groaning in spirit, as he sat plucking fowls, with a haste
and energy that brought great drops of perspiration to
his brow, hearing, every time he ventured to look up, a
shrill "You, Carl!" that instantly set him to work again
with renewed vigor.  Christie, pale, silent, and thoughtful,
bent over her sewing, near the window; and Mr. Courtney's
scowl grew every moment darker and darker.
</p>

<p>
At last, after two delightful hours, Captain Campbell
arose, reluctantly, to go, saying:
</p>

<p>
"My sister, will, doubtless, be here in a day or two,
Mrs. Courtney, and then you must become our guest.
Meantime, I shall be delighted to show you my island
home, and assist, in every way I can, to make the time of
your stay pass as pleasantly as possible."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Courtney's midnight brows grew black as a
thunder-cloud, and blacker, if possible, as his wife gayly
replied:
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir.  Nothing could give me more pleasure;
so to-morrow, I shall, with your permission, take an
inventory of your enchanting isle."
</p>

<p>
"Shall you, madam?" muttered her husband, between
his teeth.  "We shall see about that!"
</p>

<p>
All the rest of the evening Mr. Courtney was just as
silent, sulky, and sour as he knew how to be, which is
saying a good deal.  And that night, after they had retired
to the inner room which Mrs. Tom had vacated to their
use, he took her to task in the following manner:
</p>

<p>
"Pray, madam, may I ask what business you had, giving
that fellow any such promise as you did?"
</p>

<p>
Now Mrs. Courtney had seen her husband's groundless
jealousy all the evening, and had been excessively
annoyed thereby, fearing Captain Campbell might observe
it, too, and wonder at it.  Therefore, feeling justly
indignant, she coolly replied:
</p>

<p>
"Because, sir, it was my good pleasure to do so."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" and the dark brow foreboded a storm,
"indeed, Mrs. Courtney!  And is it your intention to go
roaming with this fellow, alone, through the island
to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Most assuredly, Mr. Courtney.  How astonishingly
clever you are at guessing!"
</p>

<p>
"Madam, you shall not go."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I shall go!" said the lady, imitating his tone
exactly.
</p>

<p>
"Have you no respect for yourself, madam&mdash;none for
me, your husband?"
</p>

<p>
"Not the least, sir."
</p>

<p>
"It will be at your peril if you go."
</p>

<p>
"No, it won't&mdash;it'll be at my pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"Silence, madam!" he thundered, grinding his teeth
with rage.  "Do not dare to be impertinent, or you will
repent it."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Courtney, allow me to observe, the inmates of
this house are trying to sleep.  How they will succeed, if
you go on in that manner, is a question easily answered,"
said Mrs. Courtney, sitting down, with a most provoking
coolness, and beginning to unbutton her boots.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Courtney, I command you not to go with this
man, to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Courtney, you may command till you are black
in the face; but I've promised, and I'll go!" said his
rebellious spouse.
</p>

<p>
He half sprang up from the bed in which he was lying,
his eyes fairly scintillating with rage.
</p>

<p>
"Would you dare disgrace me in this way?" he said,
in a voice hoarse with passion.
</p>

<p>
"Disgrace you?  Disgrace a fiddlestick!  Are you
losing all the little sense you ever had, Mr. Courtney?"
said his wife, now really indignant.
</p>

<p>
"Are you really smitten with&mdash;do you love this man?"
he asked, in a hoarse, fierce whisper, keeping his
gleaming, black eyes still fixed on her face.
</p>

<p>
For a moment a flash of intense anger shot from the
eyes of Mrs. Courtney; then, as if the absurdity of the
question overcame every other feeling, she threw herself
back in her chair, and broke out in a hearty peal of
laughter.
</p>

<p>
The action might have dispelled his absurd doubts;
but, as nothing can convince jealous souls, he even looked
upon this, as another proof of her guilt, and, raising
himself up in his bed, he grasped her arm, while again he
hissed:
</p>

<p>
"Do you love him?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Courtney, don't bother me!" said his polite
spouse, indignantly shaking off his hand; "and don't
make a greater simpleton of yourself than nature made
you.  Love him indeed!  I've had enough of love for
one while, I can tell you.  I found it dose enough the
last time I was fool enough to try it, and now that I've
got nicely over it, nobody'll catch me at it again."
</p>

<p>
This was a most unfortunate speech, for Courtney's
fear, day and night, was, lest his wife should cease to love
him.  He closed his teeth with a snap, and fell back on
his pillow with a sepulchral moan.
</p>

<p>
There was a pause, during which Mrs. Courtney leisurely
combed out her curls, and Mr. Courtney lay with
knit brows, and deep, labored breathing.  At length, he
turned over, and said huskily:
</p>

<p>
"Laura!"
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Laura, going on with her combing and
brushing.
</p>

<p>
"You won't go out to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Won't I?  That's all you know about it, then."
</p>

<p>
"It's my wish you should stay."
</p>

<p>
"And it's my wish to go."
</p>

<p>
"Then you <i>will</i> go?"
</p>

<p>
"Most decidedly.  And now, Mr. Courtney, hold your
tongue, for I'm going to sleep."
</p>

<p>
He clenched his teeth with impotent rage, and his
jealous soul shone forth hideously from his glittering
eyes.  And, angry and indignant, Mrs. Courtney went to
sleep, muttering:
</p>

<p>
"I vow to Cupid, you shall have some cause for jealousy,
my wise lord and master.  Pity to have you jealous
for nothing; so, handsome Captain Campbell, look out,
for I mean to flirt like fury!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
SELF-TORTURE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "And to be wroth with one we love,<br>
  Doth work like madness on the brain."&mdash;COLERIDGE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That night of deepest woe to the passionate heart
of Sibyl had been spent in pacing up and down
her room, now hurling fierce, bitter maledictions
on the head of him who had deceived her, and on this
puny girl for whose sake she had been thrown aside;
then in breathing wild, passionate vows of vengeance for
the wrong, the deep humiliation that had been done her,
and anon, throwing herself upon the floor in a convulsive
fit of weeping.  Then another mood would come, when
she would forget all but the blissful days of the past, and
all her despised love and tenderness would flood back to
her soul, and her very heart would cry out to be with him
again.  And then would come the thought that this could
never, never be again, and she would spring up with blazing
eyes, her very tears seemingly turned to sparks of
fire.
</p>

<p>
And, mingled with all these stormy passions was an
under-current of deepest shame, of bitter humiliation, of
wounded self-love and humbled pride.  That she, the
descendant of a haughty Highland clan, the daughter of
a princely race, should be forgotten for one so far
beneath her in every way, was a disgrace that sent the
blood tingling to her pale cheeks, and made her clench
her hands in impotent despair.
</p>

<p>
So passed the night.
</p>

<p>
With morning came a calmer mood.  The necessity of
adopting some line of conduct that would bring matters
to a speedy denouement soothed for the time her frenzied
brain.  No one must know as yet of her desertion.  She
felt as though she could die sooner than survive the shame
of such a discovery.  Neither could she stay on the island.
Her time for meeting her betrayer had not come; but it
was at hand, and then&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The flame that leaped like forked lightning from her
black eyes, the deep smile that curled her lips, better than
words, spoke the rest.
</p>

<p>
Leaning her head on her hand, she thought intently.
She would return to the parsonage, and remain there
until her future course was decided upon.  She could
easily feign some plausible pretext for leaving the island,
and good Mrs. Brantwell, she knew, would be but too
happy to have her.
</p>

<p>
And, in pursuance of this resolution, she went early
the following morning back to N&mdash;&mdash;.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Brantwell, as Sibyl anticipated, met her with a
joyful welcome, and announced her resolution of giving
a party a few evenings after in her welcome.  Sibyl, in her
present state of mind, would have shrunk from appearing
in public; but as she could not do so without offending
and surprising her hostess, and perhaps arousing her
suspicions, she made no resistance to the plan.
</p>

<p>
"And you know, my dear," said Mrs. Brantwell,
"now that you are an heiress, it is time that you should
come out.  Next winter you must go to New York and
spend the gay season there; for, of course, you are quite
too young to think of being married yet.  I do not believe,
for my part, in this new fashion of marrying girls before
they are out of their bibs and tuckers, and having them
settled down into old women before they are five-and-twenty.
So, my dear, just politely inform Mr. Drummond
that he must wait your ladyship's sovereign pleasure; and
if he rebels, as of course he will, give him to understand
he is not your lord and master yet, and you intend doing
as you please.  Men need to be put down, you know, my
dear; it does them good, and takes the nonsense out of
them."  And Mrs. Brantwell laughed her jolly little
laugh.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl averted her head to conceal the deadly paleness
of her face.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Sibyl," continued the good old lady, "I
want you to go with me to the island.  Guy has told me
of a lady and gentlemen who were saved from the wreck,
and are stopping at that cottage, and I wish to invite them
here to-morrow.  So go and get ready."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Brantwell, excuse me, I would rather not go,"
said Sibyl, still keeping her face averted.
</p>

<p>
"Not go!  What now, Mistress Sibyl?  This is
certainly something new," said the astonished old lady.
</p>

<p>
"I have a&mdash;headache, and would prefer lying down,"
said Sibyl, without turning round.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, in that case I suppose I must go alone.  I'll send
Betty up with some vinegar to bathe your head before I
go," said the unsuspecting lady of the mansion, as she left
the room to dress for her journey.
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell, who was waiting for her on the
shore, accompanied her to Mrs. Tom's and presented her
to pretty little Mrs. Courtney, who took captive, almost
instantly, the good lady's heart as she did that of most
other people, and promptly accepted the invitation, to the
manifest annoyance of her husband.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Courtney, though still quite weak and ailing,
resolved also upon going, to watch his wife, under the
conviction that her sole intent and purpose in going was
to meet Captain Campbell.
</p>

<p>
And Willard Drummond, who was present, likewise
received and accepted her invitation.  What his motive
in going could be, knowing Sibyl would be there, it
would be hard to divine.
</p>

<p>
The evening for the party came; and at an early hour
the drawing-room of the parsonage was all ablaze with
lights.  Carriage after carriage rolled up to the door, and
bevy after bevy of fair ladies, elegantly dressed, flocked
like bright-plumaged birds, through the brilliant rooms,
and carried on gay flirtations with their friends in
broadcloth.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Brantwell, magnificent in black velvet, stood near
the door to receive her guests.  But every eye was fixed
wonderingly, admiringly on Sibyl, who moved with the
step of an empress through the throng.
</p>

<p>
Surpassingly beautiful she looked, with her crisp,
shining curls of jet, shading on either side the burning
crimson cheeks, her splendid Syrian eyes emitting a vivid
streaming light, the rich dark robe of sheeney satin
falling with classic elegance from her rounded waist; but the
light in her eye was the fire of fever&mdash;the glow on her
cheek the blaze of excitement, for the hour she had waited
for was come, and Willard Drummond would stand
arraigned before her that night.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Courtney, bright, piquant, bewitching, divided
the honors and admiration of the evening with Sibyl.
Her husband, pale, ghastly, haggard with illness, and
suffering the tortures of a mind deceased, moved like a
specter, silent, gloomy, and watchful, through the merry
throng.  And Captain Campbell, elated, handsome, and
courteous, was there too, the recipient of many a
bewitching glance from the bright eyes present.
</p>

<p>
The company were all assembled, chatting, laughing,
fluting, all but one.  Sibyl stood in the midst of a gay
group, the "bright particular star" of the evening,
carrying on a spirited conversation, but ever and anon her
eyes would wander to the door with fierce impatience.
Why did he not come?
</p>

<p>
Edgar Courtney, standing gloomily by himself, was
enduring the torments of a lost soul.  His wife, knowing
he was unequal to the effort, had endeavored to persuade
him to stay; but this he ascribed to the wish of being
alone with Captain Campbell.  Then she offered to
remain with him; and this, also, he refused, thinking,
with strange self-torture, some evil design lay beneath.
He would come&mdash;he would watch her; and Mrs. Courtney's
high spirit arose, and she proudly and angrily
resolved to act just as she pleased, and flirt just as
desperately as she could.  She had told him she did not love
him&mdash;she had gone in defiance of his express command,
in company with Captain Campbell, walking through the
island; and from this slight foundation, Mr. Courtney
judged his wife had fallen in love with Captain
Campbell.  Where his wife was concerned the man was a
monomaniac.
</p>

<p>
And now he saw them before him, she leaning on his
arm; her head bent, as with downcast eyes and smiling
lips she listened to his low words.  He gnashed his teeth,
and glared upon them like a madman.  At that moment
his face was like that of a demon.
</p>

<p>
There was no dancing.  Mr. Brantwell was a clergyman,
and did not approve of it; but there was music, and
as if to excite his jealous soul to madness, Captain
Campbell led Laura to the piano, and hung over her, while she
glanced slyly at him from under her long lashes, and sang
"Oh, had we some bright little isle of our own," as
though every word was meant for him alone.
</p>

<p>
Loud and long was the applause which followed.
And then Captain Campbell led her to a seat, and took
another beside her, and this low conversation was
resumed.
</p>

<p>
Full with jealous rage, the self-tortured Courtney
watched them, until, at the end of an hour or so, he saw
Captain Campbell rise and leave her alone for a moment.
Then, going over, and seeing all were too much engaged,
by some one who was singing, to notice him, he grasped
her fiercely by the arm, saying, in a hoarse whisper:
</p>

<p>
"Madam, do you mean to drive me mad?"
</p>

<p>
"No need; you're that already," said Mrs. Courtney,
startled out of a reverie she had fallen into, but instantly
remembering to be provoking.
</p>

<p>
"By heavens!  I shall make you repent this conduct."
</p>

<p>
"Hush-sh!  You mustn't speak so loud, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Courtney, will you tell me what you mean by
permitting the attentions of this puppy?" he said,
clenching his teeth to keep down his passion.
</p>

<p>
"Puppy!  I'm surprised at your want of taste,
Mr. Courtney.  He's as handsome as Apollo."
</p>

<p>
"Ah-h!"
</p>

<p>
It was like a groan from a sepulcher, that deep, hollow
respiration from his labored chest.  He looked really a
pitiable object, as he sat there, white, ghastly, and rigid.
It touched with remorse his wife's heart, and, laying her
hand on his arm, she said, more seriously:
</p>

<p>
"Edgar, don't be absurd.  Positively you are as jealous
as a Turk.  I wish to goodness you wouldn't make
yourself ridiculous this way."
</p>

<p>
"Laura, come away!"
</p>

<p>
"Come away!  Where?"
</p>

<p>
"Out of this&mdash;any place&mdash;to the island again."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Mr. Courtney! what an idea!  I haven't
the slightest intention of going away these two hours.
It's very pleasant here."
</p>

<p>
"Lord!  I am miserable in it."
</p>

<p>
"That's because, like little Jack Horner, you 'sit in
the corner,' instead of mingling with the rest.  I've seen
some of the people looking at you as if they thought
you were crazy."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be, if you continue this conduct much
longer."
</p>

<p>
No one could look in his pale, haggard face and doubt
the truth of his words.  But Mrs. Courtney lost all
patience.
</p>

<p>
"What, in the name of all the saints, have I done?"
she burst out, angrily.  "My own husband sits up like a
living automaton in a dark corner, and pays me no more
attention than if there wasn't such a pretty little person
as Mrs. Courtney in existence; and because another
gentleman, who has better taste, and doesn't wish to see me
pining to death in solitude, pays me a few trifling
attentions here, you come making as much fuss as if I were
going to elope with him to-morrow.  I declare I <i>will</i> too,
if you don't let me alone."
</p>

<p>
"You will!"
</p>

<p>
And the hollow eyes glared like those of a maniac.
Even the taunting little wife quailed before it.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!  'Angels and ministers of grace defend us!'
what a look that was.  Really, Mr. Courtney, you are a
ghoul, a vampire&mdash;a Vandal, a Goth!  You'll scare the
life out of me some day, if you don't take care.  I wish to
mercy you could be a little more reasonable, and not
make such a goose of yourself!" said Mrs. Courtney,
edging away from him.
</p>

<p>
"Take care, madam; it is not safe to trifle with me!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, who in the name of mercy, <i>is</i> trifling with you?
Not I, I'm sure.  And now, Mr. Courtney, here comes
Captain Campbell; and do, for goodness sake! drop this
subject, and don't make a laughing-stock of yourself and
me, too.  What under the sun would the man think if he
heard you?"
</p>

<p>
"Do not fear, Mrs. Courtney; I will not interrupt
your <i>tete-a-tete</i> with the gallant captain," said her husband,
rising, with a ghastly smile.  "I leave you to his care,
satisfied you will make the best possible use of your
time."
</p>

<p>
"That I will!" said his irritated spouse, turning her
back indignantly on him, and greeting Captain Campbell
with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in that scene of gayety, there were at least two
tempest-tossed, jealous, passionate hearts&mdash;Edgar
Courtney and Sibyl Campbell.
</p>

<p>
All the evening she had watched the door with burning,
feverish impatience.  Why, oh! why, did he not
come.
</p>

<p>
Her heart was swelling, throbbing, as if it would
escape from its frail tenement.  She was growing wild,
mad, with impatience and excitement.  And yet, in spite
of all her watching, he had entered unobserved by her.
</p>

<p>
At last, wrought up to an uncontrollable pitch of
excitement, that was beginning to betray itself in every
feverish action, she fled from the crowd that surrounded
her, only anxious to be alone, feeling half crazed with her
throbbing head and brow.  A conservatory, cool, shady,
and deserted, was near.  Hither she went; and pushing
open the door, entered.
</p>

<p>
A man stood revealed under the light of the chandelier.
</p>

<p>
With a suppressed cry of mingled surprise and fierce
joy, she stepped back, and Sibyl and her false lover stood
face to face.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
FALSEHOOD AND DECEIT.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Ah! what a tangled web we weave,<br>
  When first we practice to deceive."&mdash;SCOTT.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was a moment's profound silence, while
they stood there confronting each other.
</p>

<p>
With a face perfectly white, with blazing eyes and
rigid lips, Sibyl, majestic in her wrongs, stood erect before
him, her form drawn up to its fullest height, her head
thrown back, her pale face looking unnaturally white in
contrast with her dark hair, like some tragic queen in her
festal robes.
</p>

<p>
All his falsehood, treachery, and deceit&mdash;all her
own wrongs, her slighted love, her deep humiliation,
rushed in a burning torrent through her mind, filling her
heart and soul with one consuming longing for vengeance,
until she seemed to tower above him, regal in her
woman's scorn and hate.
</p>

<p>
And he, knowing his guilt, feeling, too, that she knew
it, momentarily quailed before the dark, fierce glance bent
upon him.  It was but for a moment, and then all his
self-possession and graceful ease of manner returned, mingled
with a feeling of intense admiration for the darkly
beautiful girl before him.
</p>

<p>
He had never seen her before, save in her odd, gypsyish
dress; but now, in her rich, elegant robes, she looked
another being.  And with it came another revelation.
Underlying all his short-lived passion for Christie was
still the old affection for this queenly Sibyl.  He had
wooed her as a dowerless bride, but now she stood before
him the heiress to a princely fortune, equal to his own.
Willard Drummond was ambitious.  He knew this beauty
and heiress would be sought for now by the best men of
the day, and he felt what a proud triumph it would be to
bear her off from all.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, inwardly, "this beautiful Sibyl, this
regal Queen of the Isle, shall be mine.  I have
commenced a desperate game, but the end is not yet."
</p>

<p>
And all this had passed through the minds of both in
far less time than it has taken to describe it.
</p>

<p>
Drummond was the first to break the silence, which
was growing embarrassing.
</p>

<p>
"My own Sibyl," he said, advancing, and attempting
to take her hand, "I began to fear we were destined never
to meet more.  Has this new freak of Dame Fortune
made you forget all your old friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Back, sir!" she thundered, in a terrible voice.  "Do
you dare speak to me like this!  Oh, man! false and
perjured, does not your craven soul shrink to the dust before
the woman you have wronged?"
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, you are mad!" he cried, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
"Mad!  Oh, would to Heaven I were!  Then, perhaps,
this aching heart would not suffer the tortures that
it does.  Mad?  It would be well for you if I were; but
I am sane enough, to live for vengeance on you."
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl!  Sibyl! you rave!  In Heaven's name, what
have I done?"
</p>

<p>
"Done?  Oh, falsest of the false! have you the brazen
effrontery, to stand before me, and ask such a question as
that?  Done!&mdash;that, which a life-time can never repair.
May Heaven's worst curses light on you, for what you
have done!"
</p>

<p>
He almost shrank before that white, terrible face, that
corrugated brow, those lightning eyes, those white, cold
lips, that mingled look of hatred and utter desolation,
her beautiful countenance wore.
</p>

<p>
He had expected passionate reproaches, vehement
accusations, but nothing like this.  Yet, he knew, he felt,
he deserved it all.  Never, had his crime appeared before
him, in such glaring colors before.  But, outwardly, he
still showed no sign of guilt, only grave surprise and
offended pride.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Campbell," he said, folding his arms, coldly,
"you are crazed.  When you recover your senses, perhaps
you will deign an explanation of your conduct.  At
present, you will excuse me, if I put an end to this
interview; it is too painful to be prolonged."
</p>

<p>
He turned, as if to leave her; but she sprang forward
and intercepted him.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Dare</i> to leave me!" she cried, passionately.  "Never
shall you quit this room, until you hear the vengeance a
Campbell can take for a foul wrong, and deadly insult.
Crazed, am I?  Oh, you will find out, to your cost, there
is method in my madness, before this interview ends.
You find it painful, do you?  Ha! ha! take care you do
not find it more so, before we part."
</p>

<p>
She pushed the thick, clustering, black hair back off
her brow, and laughed a wild, bitter laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens! she looks as though she really were
mad," thought Willard, with a shudder at that hollow,
unearthly laugh.  "I always knew her to be a wild, fiery,
passionate girl, but I never dreamed of anything like this.
What, in her frenzy, may she not dare to do; for, verily,
she comes of a daring race.  Oh, Christie!  Christie! what
a storm of passion have I not raised for your sake!"
</p>

<p>
"So I can make you start and shrink already!"
exclaimed Sibyl, with fierce exultation.  "Oh, you will
find what it is to drive Sibyl Campbell to desperation.
So you thought you could make me your plaything for
an hour, and then throw me aside for the first new face
you encountered.  Oh, potent, wise and far-seeing
Willard Drummond, what a judge of character thou art!"
</p>

<p>
Her bitter mockery was worse than her first, fierce
outburst of passion, and there was a terrible menace
lurking, yet, in her gleaming, black eyes.
</p>

<p>
But Willard stood looking on, still unmoved, only
amazed, as he stood, with one hand resting lightly on the
table, looking her straight in the eye with cold hauteur.
</p>

<p>
That steady, concentrated gaze had on her the effect
of mesmerism.  Her mood changed, and she broke forth
in a strain of passionate solemnity:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my soul! was it for this I poured out such priceless
treasures of love at this man's feet?  Was it for this
I forgot God to worship <i>him</i>?  Was it for this that I
would have given my soul to perdition that his might be
saved?  Was it for this I would have devoted my life,
with all its high hopes and aspirations, all that I was, all
that I might become, to make him happy?  Was it for
this that I thought of him day and night, sleeping and
waking?  Was it for a return like this that I would have
given my very life-blood to free him from all pain?  Oh,
this heart&mdash;this heart!  Oh, my lost faith! my blasted
hopes! my ruined life!  Wealth, and youth, and beauty,
were given to me, but what are they worth, when all is
desolation here?"
</p>

<p>
She struck her breast with her clenched hand, and
dropping into a seat, her arms fell upon the table, and
her grief-bowed young head dropped heavily upon them.
</p>

<p>
The dead silence that for an instant followed her vehement
outburst, was like a sudden lull in a furious storm
when the spirit of the tempest pauses for a moment, and
breaks forth in redoubled fury.
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl!"
</p>

<p>
Soft, low, and gentle, like oil poured upon troubled
waves, came the voice of Willard Drummond to her
passion-tossed heart, that voice which, in spite of all, was
still dearer to her than all the world beside.
</p>

<p>
Only a convulsive shiver, a fierce grasping of her
breast, as though she would tear from it the unspeakable
gnawing of her agony, but no reply.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Sibyl!"
</p>

<p>
He came over, and folding her in his arms, bent over
her till his face rested on her silken hair.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard!" she cried, looking suddenly up, and
speaking in a tone of piercing anguish, "why did you
deceive me so?"
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, speak and tell me what you mean.  As heaven
hears me I have not deceived you.  I love you still, as I
have always loved you!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if I might believe it!" she said, dashing back the
falling hair off her pallid brow, "if I dared to dream that
you spoke the truth.  But no, no!" she cried, springing
up and freeing herself from his clasp, "it is false&mdash;it is
false as your own false heart!  Listen, and let the name
blight you where you stand.  What of Christie?"
</p>

<p>
Her menacing eyes were glaring upon him as though
she would read his very soul; but, prepared for her
question, he neither started nor betrayed the slightest
emotion.
</p>

<p>
"Christie, the island-girl&mdash;what of her?" he asked,
quietly.
</p>

<p>
"What of her?  Man, man! you will drive me mad!
Do you not love her?"
</p>

<p>
"Love her&mdash;that little, uncultured child?  Sibyl, you
have lost your reason," he said, in a tone of well-feigned
surprise and indignation.  "What drove such an absurd
thought into your head?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she told me so&mdash;she told me so!" wailed Sibyl,
pressing her hands to her throbbing temples.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!  You must have dreamed it, Sibyl, She
never could have told you anything like that."
</p>

<p>
"She did; and I could have slain her where she stood
for the words; but she said them.  And, Willard
Drummond, do not deny it&mdash;<i>it is true</i>."
</p>

<p>
"It is not true!" he boldly answered, though for the
first time during the interview his dark cheek grew
crimson with shame.
</p>

<p>
"It is true&mdash;it <i>must</i> be.  She would not have said it
else.  Oh, there was truth in her face as she spoke, and
there is guilt in yours now.  Willard Drummond, take
care!  I am desperate, and it is at your peril that you
dare to trifle with me now."
</p>

<p>
"And so you believe this island-girl rather than me.
Be it so, Sibyl; if you have no more faith in me than
this, it is better that we never see each other more," he
said, in a deeply offended tone.
</p>

<p>
"And do you tell me, really and truly, that you never
wavered in your allegiance to me&mdash;never for a moment
thought of any one else&mdash;never for one second gave
another the place in your heart I should have occupied&mdash;never
was false to your vows, to your honor, to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Never, Sibyl!"
</p>

<p>
"Swear it!"
</p>

<p>
"I swear!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, which am I to believe?  Oh, Willard, if you are
deceiving me now, may Heaven's worst vengeance fall
upon you!  Do not, on your soul's peril, dare to speak
falsely to me; for it were better for you to trifle with the
lightning's chain than with this aroused heart.'
</p>

<p>
"Still doubting! have you lost <i>all</i> faith in me, Sibyl?"
he asked, reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Would to heaven I had never had occasion to doubt!
But your own actions are all against you.  Why did you
so continually seek her society while on the island?  How
are your long rambles together, your moonlight sails,
your solitary interviews to be explained?"
</p>

<p>
"Very easily.  Your brother left me; you were absent,
and I was alone on the island, and society is a necessity
of my nature.  You would not have me spend the day
with your old negress or her son; Mrs. Tom or her
nephew.  The child, Christie, was bright, intelligent, and
sociable; she pleased and interested me, and in my walks
through the island we frequently met.  I was fond of
sailing; so was she; and what so natural as that I should
sometimes ask her to accompany me?"
</p>

<p>
"Plausible!  But why did you not seek <i>me</i>?  I was
not far distant from you, a good part of the time, and
would have been more than delighted to see you every
day."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if I must confess it, Sibyl, I was somewhat
piqued that you should have gone away at all, and wished
to let you know it by my absence.  Perhaps it was very
unreasonable on my part, but, loving you as devotedly as
I did, I felt your abrupt absence far more than you are
disposed to give me credit for."
</p>

<p>
"But, when alone, why were you ever talking of
Christie?  If she had not been continually in your
thoughts, her name would not have been so frequently on
your lips."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Still</i> jealous!  Oh, Sibyl! hard to be convinced!  I did
not talk of her."
</p>

<p>
"You did; for Aunt Moil heard you."
</p>

<p>
"Saints and angels! was ever man in the same dilemma
I am in?  Even an old, half-deaf negress is believed
sooner than I!  Sibyl, I <i>never</i> talk to myself.  Aunt Moll
has seen me with this island girl&mdash;whom I wish to Heaven
I had never met&mdash;and has fancied, perhaps, I spoke of her.
Oh, Sibyl!  Sibyl! by your dark, doubting look, I see you
are unbelieving still.  What shall I do, or say, to
convince you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do not know&mdash;I do not know!  Heaven direct
me!" said Sibyl, pacing up and down.  "I <i>want</i> to believe
you, but I cannot get rid of those doubts.  Willard, once
our faith in those we love and trust is shaken, it is very
hard to be renewed.  There were truth and earnestness in
that girl's eyes when she spoke&mdash;more, there was love for
you.  Whether or not you love, or have loved her, one
thing is certain&mdash;you have taught her to love <i>you</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I have not taught her, Sibyl, nor am I to blame for
her childish fancies.  Even if she does care for me, which
Is doubtful, it is a sisterly affection&mdash;nothing more."
</p>

<p>
"I am not blind, Willard.  It was no sisterly affection
read in those soft, pleading eyes; it was strong, unchanging,
undying love.  Oh, Willard! what if you are deceiving
us both?"
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, this is too much!  I will not endure those
doubts.  You do not love me as you say you do, or you
would have more faith in me.  If you believe I could so
forget my vows to you, my honor, my plighted faith, for
this little artless child, then it were better we should
forever part than live in doubt and jealousy.  Do you think
I could endure these constant recriminations, these stormy
scenes, these violent outbursts of passion?  Sibyl, it is
beneath you to stoop to the mean, low passion of jealousy.
I thought you had too much pride and self-respect to
think any one, no matter how beautiful and enchanting,
could surpass you.  And certainly you pay a very poor
compliment to my taste in supposing that I could fall in
with an illiterate, uneducated child of fifteen, simply
because she has a passably pretty face.  Sibyl, you are
surpassing beautiful and I have to-night seen gentlemen
whom I am sure were fascinated by you, hovering the
whole evening by your side, while you seemed to have
eyes and ears for no one but them; yet it never once
entered my mind to doubt you, or be in the slightest
degree jealous."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes; I talked and laughed with them; but, oh! if
you had known how every thought and feeling of my
whole heart, and soul, and mind were with you all the
time&mdash;if you had but dreamed of the insufferable agony
at my heart all the while, you would have felt how little
cause you could have had for jealousy."
</p>

<p>
"I knew nothing of this, Sibyl, and yet, for not one
fraction or a second did the slightest, faintest doubt of
you enter my mind.  Oh, Sibyl!  Sibyl! when will you
have faith like this in me?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Now!</i>&mdash;forever!  Oh, Willard, I must believe&mdash;I do
believe, and I will never doubt you more!" said Sibyl,
her beautiful face growing radiant with new hope.  "If
I judged you rashly, at least I have atoned for it, for
never while you live can you dream of all I have endured
for your sake.  Oh, Willard, with your cool nature and
calmly pulsating heart, you can never form any idea of
the passionate heart throbbing here&mdash;of the fiery blood
that has descended to me from a fiery race.  Oh, Willard,
for all my unjust doubts, and suspicions, and accusations,
can you ever forgive me!"
</p>

<p>
He had borne her frenzied outbursts of passion, her
bitter, withering sarcasm, her utter woe and desolation,
calmly enough; but now her renewed hopes, and trust,
and confidence, pierced to his very heart.  He felt the
blood rush to his very temples, but her head was bent
on his shoulder, and she did not observe it.  How intensely
in that moment did he despise himself, and this necessity
of lying, which his own fault had created!  Without
thinking of the guilt, as a gentlemen he felt himself
degraded by a falsehood&mdash;something which he had never
hitherto stained his lips with.  And yet, in the last hour
how low he had sunk!  Verily, in that moment he felt
"the way of the transgressor is hard."
</p>

<p>
But Sibyl Campbell, loving and hating alike with utter
abandon&mdash;going from one extreme to the other, without
knowing what a medium meant&mdash;knew nothing of the
thoughts that set the heart she prized even above her hope
of heaven, beating so tumultuously against her own.
Casting all doubt to the winds, resolving she would not
believe him guilty&mdash;the delicious joy of knowing and
believing she was still beloved filled her heart.  And so
for the present she gave herself wholly up to this new
happiness.  But how long was this delicious joy destined
to last?

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
A LULL BEFORE THE TEMPEST.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "We hold our greyhound in our hand,<br>
  Our falcon on our glove;<br>
  But where shall we find leash or band<br>
  For dame that loves to rove?"&mdash;SCOTT.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Now, my dear Mrs. Courtney, you really must not
think of going back to the island, any more.
Sibyl is to remain with me, for a week or two
longer, and you, positively, must stay, for, let me tell you,
I have taken a desperate fancy to you, during the last few
hours.  Then, too, Sibyl, poor child! has seemed ill and
out of spirits for the past few days&mdash;-and the presence of
your lively little ladyship will tend to restore her to
cheerfulness, again.  So, Mrs. Courtney, you will just
consider it settled; and, yourself, and husband must
remain my guests for the present."
</p>

<p>
The company, were already dispersing, and Mrs. Courtney,
on going to take leave of her hostess, had
listened to the above harangue.
</p>

<p>
"But, Mr. Courtney," she began, rather hesitatingly,
</p>

<p>
"He will not object, my dear!" broke in Mrs. Brantwell,
who was comfortably reposing in a large arm-chair.
"He is looking ill, yet, and I don't believe his wound has
been half attended to.  Just go and tell him, that I say he
must stay.  I would go myself, only there is a crowd
here, waiting to take their leave, and make their adieus.
Mrs. Courtney, it's not possible&mdash;you do not hesitate.
What earthly attraction can there be for you, in that
dreary, little isle?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mrs. Brantwell! it's not that; indeed, I shall be
delighted to accept your kind offer; but, Mr. Courtney
is sometimes so queer, and has such strange notions about
intruding on people, that I do not know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Intrude!  Nonsense!" interrupted Mrs. Brantwell.
"I'm sure there's nobody in this world, as fond of society
as I am.  I'd always have the house full of young people
if I could.  There now, run away, like a good, little
woman and tell your husband that I positively will not
hear of his going.  Come, be off; here is Mr. Stafford,
waiting to bid me good-by, and, I never care to keep a
young gentleman waiting&mdash;especially such a good-looking
one; though, I don't know what Mr. Brantwell would
say about that!"
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Brantwell gave Laura a facetious poke in
the ribs, and went off into one of her mellow laughs.
</p>

<p>
Inwardly delighted at Mrs. Brantwell's invitation,
which gave promise of much pleasure, Laura went in
search of her husband, fully determined to accept it,
whether that unreasonable individual liked it or not.
</p>

<p>
She found him waiting for her, in the ante-room, all
ready for starting.
</p>

<p>
"What has delayed you so long?" he asked, sharply.
"I have been waiting here this half hour.  I have sent one
of the servants to hire a cab to take us over to Westport&mdash;where
for the present we can engage lodgings, instead of
returning to Campbell's Isle&mdash;a place I never want to see
again.  Come, make haste and get ready."
</p>

<p>
"There's no occasion, for I'm not going to leave."
</p>

<p>
"Not going to leave?  What do you mean, madam?"
he asked, still more sharply.
</p>

<p>
"What I say.  Are you really crazy enough, Mr. Courtney,
to think I would undertake a two-hours' ride over to
Westport, after being up all night?  Catch me at it!  I
have too much regard for my good looks to undertake
any such journey."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! you wish to return to the island?" he said, setting
his teeth hard.  "Captain Campbell, of course, will
accompany you?"
</p>

<p>
"How provoking!  Every word I say is converted
into food for jealousy.  No, I don't want to go back to
the island.  I'm going to spend a week here with
Mrs. Brantwell."
</p>

<p>
"You shall not stay here.  You shall come with me to
Westport."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I, indeed?  They'll have sharp eyes that will
see me in Westport for another week, at least.  Come,
Edgar, have sense, and stay here for a few days."
</p>

<p>
"Will Captain Campbell be here?"
</p>

<p>
"Captain Campbell again.  Oh, grant me patience!
How do I know whether he will be here or not?  I'm sure
I hope he may, if it's only to drive you crazy; for, of all
the absurd, jealous old tyrants that ever lived you're the
worst.  I declare, Mr. Courtney, you'd provoke a saint;
and I do wish&mdash;St. Laura forgive me&mdash;that you were
safely in heaven.  There, now!"
</p>

<p>
"Take care, madam!" he said, hoarsely; "your good
wishes are premature.  Old tyrant as I am, I may live
long enough to make you repent this language."
</p>

<p>
"Take care of what?  I'm not afraid of you, Edgar
Courtney!" she said, with flashing eyes.  "Don't threaten,
or you may drive me to say things I should be sorry for
afterward."
</p>

<p>
"Once for all, will you come with me to Westport?"
</p>

<p>
"Once for all, no!"
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I command you!"
</p>

<p>
"Command away, then; I sha'n't budge a step."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Courtney, do you dare to brave my authority?"
</p>

<p>
"Your authority!  It isn't the first time I have braved
it."
</p>

<p>
"Take care that it is not the last!" he hissed, with
gleaming eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!  Don't look at me that way," said Laura, shuddering
involuntarily at his unearthly look and tone.  "I
declare, if you're not enough to scare a person into the
fever and ague!  What a scowl!  Edgar Courtney, you're
worse than Nero, Heliogabalus, Mohammed, and all the
other nasty old fellows, melted into one.  Now I've made
up my mind to stay here with Mrs. Brantwell, whether
you like it or not; and you may do as you please, for all
I care.  Allow me to wish you good-night, and a pleasant
journey to Westport."
</p>

<p>
And turning abruptly around, the indignant little lady
quitted the room, leaving her spouse to his own not very
pleasant reflections.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The company, by this time, had nearly all departed.
Drummond, hat in hand, stood near the window, talking
in low tones to Sibyl, whose face was now bright, radiant,
unclouded.
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Brantwell were still holding a parting
conversation with some of their friends, among whom,
stood young Stafford, watching Mr. Drummond, with a
ferocious glance.
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell stood by himself, evidently waiting
for his friend to accompany him to the isle.
</p>

<p>
As Mrs. Courtney entered, he approached her, saying,
with a smile:
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mrs. Courtney, are you not going to return
with us to the island?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I think not," said Laura.  "I have accepted our
kind hostess' invitation, to remain with her a week."
</p>

<p>
"Weil, I have no doubt you will find it pleasanter
than our lonesome isle, though, we poor unfortunates,
left behind will find it doubly dreary, now, that it is
deprived of your bright presence."
</p>

<p>
"Flatterer&mdash;flattery!  I don't believe I'll ever be
missed.  You must remember me to good Mrs. Tom, her
pretty niece, Christie, and that ill-treated youth, Mr. Carl
Henley."
</p>

<p>
"Your humble servant hears but to obey.  But, my
dear Mrs. Courtney, you must not desert us, altogether.
Will you not visit the island some day during the week?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I may; indeed, it's very likely I shall.  I
want to see Mrs. Tom, before I start for home; so, if I
can prevail on Miss Campbell to accompany me, your
Island will be blessed with my 'bright presence,' once
more."
</p>

<p>
"A blessing, for which, we shall be duly grateful,"
said Captain Campbell, gayly; "so, just name the day
that I shall have the happiness of coming for you, and I
shall safely convey you, 'over the sea in my fairy bark.'"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Captain Campbell, how distressingly poetical
you are getting!" said Laura, laughing.  "Well, let's
see.  This is Tuesday, isn't it?  Then, I think I will go
on Thursday&mdash;day after to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, on that day, I shall have the happiness of
coming for you.  Until then, adieu."
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, Captain Campbell," said Mrs. Courtney,
holding out her hand.
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, a slight noise behind her, made her turn
abruptly round, and she almost shrieked aloud, as she
beheld her husband&mdash;white, ghastly, and haggard&mdash;standing
like a galvanized corpse, by her side.  He had
entered, unobserved, and approached them in time to
hear their last words&mdash;to hear them make an appointment.
</p>

<p>
What other proof of her guilt, did he require?  His
worst suspicions were, of course, confirmed.  Oh! terrible,
was the look his face wore at that moment, Without
a word, he turned away, and walked to the further end of
the room.
</p>

<p>
Startled, shocked, and sick with undefined apprehension,
Laura leaned against the table, for support.  Captain
Campbell's eyes followed the jealous husband, with a
look, that said as plainly as words, "what does all this
mean?"
</p>

<p>
"You are ill, Mrs. Courtney," he said, noticing with
alarm her sudden faintness.  "Allow me to ring for a
glass of water."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  It is nothing," she said, passing her hand
across her brow, as if to dispel a mist.  "Nothing
whatever," she added, rising and forcing a smile as she saw
his anxious look.  "Excuse me.  Good night."
</p>

<p>
She hastened away, and Captain Campbell, after a
moment's wondering pause, approached the spot where
Willard and Sibyl stood, and touching him on the
shoulder, said, somewhat impatiently:
</p>

<p>
"Come, Drummond, it's time we were off, if we go at
all.  Even as it is, it will be sunrise before we reach the
island."
</p>

<p>
In spite of all her efforts a cloud fell on Sibyl's sunny
brow at his words.  The demon of Doubt was not yet
wholly exorcised.  The island! the name grated harshly
on her ear, for Christie was there.
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond saw it, and his resolution was
taken.  He felt it would not do to return to the island
just now.
</p>

<p>
"I regret having kept you waiting," he said, gravely;
"but I do not intend going to the island just yet."
</p>

<p>
A radiant glance from Sibyl's beautiful eyes repaid
him for the words.  But Captain Campbell was amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Not return?  Why, what's in you head, now, Drummond?
Where are you going?" he asked, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"For the present, I shall stay here."
</p>

<p>
"Here, at Mr. Brantwell's?"
</p>

<p>
"No, in the village."
</p>

<p>
"Tired of Campbell's Isle already, eh?  I knew how
it would be.  Well, I suppose I'll have to submit to keep
bachelor's hall alone for a day or two, and then I shall
return to Westport to see after my bonny bark.  As the
Courtneys stay, likewise, I shall have to go alone; so
<i>au revoir</i>."
</p>

<p>
And Captain Campbell, after exchanging a word
with his hostess, left the house to return to Campbell
Lodge.
</p>

<p>
The few remaining guests by this time, had gone;
and Willard Drummond, also, took his departure.  And
then Sibyl took her night-lamp and retired to her room
to dream of her new-found happiness.
</p>

<p>
Laura Courtney sat alone on a sofa in a remote
corner, her head on her hand, her brows knit in painful
thought.  This fierce jealousy of her husband's was
growing insufferable; she felt she could not endure it
much longer.  Every word, every look, every action was
warped and distorted by his jealous imagination into
another proof of her guilt.  And she painfully felt that
this absurd jealousy must soon be apparent to every
one&mdash;an almost unendurable thought; for, in spite of
all her levity and apparent indifference, the little
girl-wife possessed too much pride and self-respect to
carelessly submit to such a bitter humiliation.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I knew what to do," she thought.  "If I
submit to all his whims and caprices, it will only make
matters worse.  Nothing can remove this deep-rooted
passion, and the yoke he will lay on my neck will become
unbearable.  Oh, I was mad, crazed, ever to marry him.
Every one that knew him told me how it would be&mdash;that
he was tyrannical, jealous, exacting, and passionate,
but I only laughed at them, and deemed him perfection.
How I could ever have loved him, I'm sure I don't know,
for he hasn't a single lovable quality in him.  However,
it's too late to think of this now; I want to forget the
past altogether, if I can, and my folly with it.  Good
gracious! what an awful look was on his face that time
when I turned round.  Perhaps, after all, I had better
not go to the island.  The man's a monomaniac on this
point, and it won't do to drive him to desperation."
</p>

<p>
She bent her forehead on her hand, and remained for
a few moments lost in troubled thought.
</p>

<p>
"No, I shall not go; but I will not give him the triumph
of knowing it.  He shall not think I am afraid of
him, and that he has humbled me at last," she said, half
aloud, as she raised her head proudly.  "I will avoid
Captain Campbell, too, as much as possible, if I can do
so without attracting attention.  Heigho! what it is to
have a jealous husband!  I wonder where Edgar is?
Perhaps he has gone to Westport, and left me here!"
</p>

<p>
"Prithee, why so sad?" said the jovial voice of
Mrs. Brantwell, breaking in at this moment on her reverie.
</p>

<p>
"You are looking as doleful as if some near relation had
just been hung for sheep-stealing.  Come, I can't allow
any one in my house to wear so doleful a face.  Don't
indulge in the blues, my dear, or you need never expect
to wax fat and portly, as I am.  Come, let me see you
smile, now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mrs. Brantwell! who could be sad in your sunshiny
presence," said Laura, smiling as brightly as even
the good old lady could wish; "but, really, I wasn't out
of spirits&mdash;only dreadfully sleepy."  And an immense
yawn confirmed the truth of her words.
</p>

<p>
"No wonder; it's four o'clock, so you had better
retire.  Jenny will show you to your room."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see&mdash;has Mr. Courtney&mdash;" began Laura,
hesitatingly, as she rose.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Courtney went to bed a quarter of an hour ago,
my dear.  And here's Jenny, now, with your lamp.
Good-night, love!"  And kissing her, Mrs. Brantwell consigned
her to the charge of a neat mulatto girl, who appeared
with a light at the door.
</p>

<p>
Laura followed her up stairs to the door of her
apartment.  And here Jenny handed her the light, dropped a
courtesy, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Courtney opened the door and entered.  It was a
neat, pretty little room, with white curtains on the
windows and white dimity hangings on the bed; a wan-hued
carpet on the floor, and a cozy arm-chair beside the
window.  Mr. Courtney sat on the bed, still dressed in his
evening costume&mdash;his arm resting on the snowy pillows
and his face bowed upon it.  His dark elf-locks fell
heavily over the white pillows, as he lay as motionless as
though death had stifled forever his wildly Throbbing
heart.
</p>

<p>
He looked up as his wife entered, and dashes back his
long, dark hair.  Laura really felt for him&mdash;the wretched
victim of his own turbulent passions&mdash;but pity and
sympathy she knew would be alike misunderstood by him, if
manifested; and even, perhaps, be adding fuel to the
flames already raging in his breast.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! you are here, are you?" she said, setting her
lamp on the toilet-stand, and throwing herself languidly
in the arm-chair, "I thought you had gone to Westport."
</p>

<p>
"And left you to flirt with your new lover.  Ha!  Ha!
You thought so, did you?"
</p>

<p>
What a goblin laugh it was.  Laura shivered involuntarily,
but she would not abate one jot of her defiant sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I saw you playing the eavesdropper," she said,
as she began taking off her collar and bracelets; "it is
just what I expected of you.  You did it so expertly, one
would think you had been taking lessons all your life, in
listening at keyholes.  Perhaps, you have learned from
some hotel-waiter, or lady's maid."
</p>

<p>
"By Heaven!  I will strangle you!" he exclaimed,
roused to madness by her taunting tone.  And he sprang
to his feet, glaring upon her, as though he would fulfill
his threat.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Mr. Courtney, be calm, or I shall be under
the painful necessity of going down stairs, and inquiring
where the nearest lunatic asylum is located.  Don't rave,
now, or try to transfix me with your flashing glances.
I am not, in the slightest degree, afraid of you,
Mr. Courtney."
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Courtney drew her little form up to its full
height, and looked with cool contempt, in his face.
</p>

<p>
"Madam! if you go to the island, I swear, by heaven,
and all its hosts, it will be the dearest night's work you
have ever done."
</p>

<p>
"Hem!  Why don't you swear by the other place; you
are likely to know more about it, some day, than you will
ever know of heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" he shouted, in a fierce voice, "I repeat
it; if you keep this appointment with Captain Campbell,
you shall repent it, in dust and ashes!"
</p>

<p>
For a moment, he stood perfectly paralyzed, foaming
at the mouth like a wild beast.  Even the audacious
Mrs. Courtney, trembled before the terrible pitch of passion,
she had daringly excited.  And with it, came another
feeling, apprehensions for her personal safety.
</p>

<p>
Springing to her feet, she darted past him, reached the
door, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Courtney, your disagreeable temper renders it
necessary for me to leave you to solitude, which is said to
be excellent for cross people.  Hoping you will have
recovered your usual good-temper, before we meet again,
allow me, to wish you good-night."
</p>

<p>
He darted toward her, but she was gone, slamming
the door after her, and was down the stairs in a
twinkling.  She knew he would not dare to follow her; and,
reaching the dark, deserted parlor, she threw herself on a
lounge, and burst into a passionate flood of tears.  In
that moment, she fairly hated her husband.
</p>

<p>
But, when the household assembled next morning, little
Mrs. Courtney looked as bright, and smiling, and
breezy as ever, and met her pale, sour-visaged husband
with her customary, careless unconcern.  He, too, was
calm; but, it was a delusive lull in the storm.  The
treacherous peace of the sleeping volcano&mdash;the menacing
quiet of a savage, seeking revenge&mdash;a calm, more to be
dreaded, than his former, fierce outburst of passion.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
THE FATAL NOTE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven<br>
  'Tis gone.<br>
  Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell,<br>
  Yield up, oh, love, thy crown and hearted throne<br>
  To tyrannous hate!  Swell, bosom with thy fraught,<br>
  For 'tis of aspics' tongues!"&mdash;OTHELLO.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Inwardly congratulating himself on his successful
interview with Sibyl, Willard Drummond sought his
rooms to lay his plans for the future.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl must be his bride, and that soon&mdash;love, and
pride, and ambition, all demanded it.  It would be such a
triumph to carry off this beauty and heiress&mdash;this
brilliant star, who would so proudly and gloriously eclipse
the lesser lights of New York and Washington.  And
yet, though his darker angel prompted this, he
involuntarily shrank from the crime.  What was to be done
with Christie?  What would she do, when she heard of
his marriage?  Poor, deceived little Christie? his heart
smote him to think he had forgotten her already.
</p>

<p>
He did not fear her much; it was not that which
made him hesitate.  There was not a particle of revenge
in her disposition.  Meek, timid, and yielding, he knew
if he commanded her to be silent&mdash;saying his honor, his
happiness compelled him to act as he did&mdash;she would
gently fold her hands across her bosom, and die, if need
be, and "make no sign."  No, he need not fear her, but
he feared himself.  There was a fierce struggle going on
in his breast.  Once there had been before.  Then it was
between honor and passion; now it was between pity
and ambition.  How could he tell his loving, trusting
child-bride that she would never see him more&mdash;that he
had deceived her and was to marry another?  And on
the other hand, after his interview with Sibyl the
previous night, it was absolutely impossible to pursue any
other course.  Christie might suffer&mdash;die, if she would;
but Sibyl Campbell&mdash;this regal, beautiful heiress, this
transcendently lovely Queen of the Isle&mdash;must be his
wife.  His wife!  Could she be that while Christie lived?
His brain was in a whirl as he paced up and down, still
revolving the question: "What next?&mdash;what next?"
</p>

<p>
Unable to answer it, he threw himself on his bed, only
to live over again the past few weeks in feverish dreams.
</p>

<p>
It was near noon when he awoke; and, with a head
but slightly clearer than it had been the preceding night,
he set out for the parsonage.
</p>

<p>
"There is no other course for it," ran his thoughts, on
the way, "but to see Christie, and tell her all.  But how
to see her!  Sibyl's jealousy is not dead, but sleepeth;
and if I visit the isle it may break out in new fury.  I
must write a note to Christie, and send it to the island
with some one&mdash;Lem or Carl&mdash;and appoint a meeting,
after night, unknown to every one.  Yes, that is what
must be done.  Poor Christie! poor Christie!  Villain
that I am to wrong you so! but the hand of Destiny is
upon me, driving me on.  How is all this to end?  In
woe for some of us, if the Egyptian's prediction come
true.  Well, I am in the hands of Fate, and must
accomplish her ends, come what may."
</p>

<p>
He found Sibyl alone in the drawing-room when he
entered.  Mrs. Courtney and Mrs. Brantwell were
conversing in the sitting-room, while Mr. Courtney sat
silently in the depths of an elbow-chair, and scowled at
them over the top of a book.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl's welcome was most cordial, and they were soon
engaged in animated conversation.
</p>

<p>
Once, as if by accident, during the conversation, he
said:
</p>

<p>
"I have left some things I need on the island, which I
suppose I must soon go after."
</p>

<p>
"If you mention it to Guy, he will send Lem over
with them," said Sibyl, with an involuntary coldness in
her tone.
</p>

<p>
"Jealous still&mdash;I knew it," was his inward comment.
</p>

<p>
"I presume you do not intend visiting the lodge
yourself?" he asked, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"No; the island has few attractions for me now.  I
really would not care much if I never saw it again," she
answered, briefly.
</p>

<p>
And there the subject dropped.
</p>

<p>
That evening when Willard returned to his hotel, he
sat down and indicted the following note, without date
or superscription, to Christie:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAREST.&mdash;For reasons which I will explain when
we meet I cannot visit you during the day.  Meet me
to-night, on the heath below the cottage, any time before
midnight."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Lest it should by any chance fall into other hands
than those for whom it was intended, he had omitted his
name&mdash;knowing, besides, that it was not necessary, since
the person to whom he would deliver it would tell
Christie who had sent it.
</p>

<p>
Folding it up, he put it in his pocket, knowing that
either Lem or Carl would in all probability visit N&mdash;&mdash;
during the day, and he could seize the first opportunity
of handing it to either unobserved.
</p>

<p>
And thus, determined by his devoted attention to lull
her slightest doubts to rest, he set out early the
following morning for the parsonage.
</p>

<p>
This was Thursday&mdash;the day on which Mrs. Courtney
had promised to visit the isle.
</p>

<p>
The day dawned clear and beautiful, and as the family
at the Brantwell mansion assembled round the breakfast-table,
little did they dream of the appalling tragedy
with which it was destined to close.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl and her lover sat in their favorite seat in the
recess formed by the deep bay-window, talking in low,
lover-like tones.
</p>

<p>
Good Mrs. Brantwell had incased her large proportions
in a rocking-chair, and was swaying backward and
forward, plying her knitting-needles, and trying to find
some one to talk to&mdash;a somewhat difficult task; for
Mr. Courtney, sitting in sullen silence, answered coldly and
briefly, while his eyes continually followed his wife, who
was fluttering in and out in a restless, breezy sort of way,
looking every few moments out of the window, and starting
violently whenever the door opened.  Her husband
saw it, and said to himself:
</p>

<p>
"She is looking for her lover, and is watching impatiently
for his coming.  This is the morning he promised
to take her to the isle."
</p>

<p>
And his eyes assumed such a wild, maniac glare, that
Mrs. Brantwell, looking up suddenly from her work,
uttered a stifled scream as she exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Gracious me!  Mr. Courtney, are you ill?  You look
like a ghost&mdash;worse than any ghost, I declare.  I knew
your wound was not perfectly healed.  You had better
retire, and lie down."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, madam; I am perfectly well," he
answered, in a hollow tone that belied his words.
</p>

<p>
Laura, absorbed by her own thoughts, had not heard
this brief conversation.  Yes, she was watching for
Captain Campbell, with a nervous restlessness, she could not
control, but, with a far different object to that which her
husband supposed.  She wanted to see him for a moment,
before he entered, to tell him she could not go with
him, to the island, and, to beg of him, not to allude to the
subject in the presence of the others.  If he did, she
knew her husband's jealousy would be apparent to all&mdash;a
humiliation, she wished to postpone, as long as possible.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, when at last she espied him coming, she
flew down the stairs, and, flushed, eager, palpitating, met
him in the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Mrs. Courtney," he said, smiling at her
haste, "I hope I have not kept you waiting."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," she answered, eagerly.  "I wanted to tell
you, Captain Campbell, that I cannot go."
</p>

<p>
"No?" he said, looking somewhat disappointed.
"Then, perhaps, you will come to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Neither to-morrow nor ever.  I cannot explain now,
but, I wanted to tell you this, before you met the others.
Don't say anything about this, up stairs; and, if my
conduct appears strange, set it down to woman's fickleness,
to eccentricity, to anything you like."
</p>

<p>
She did not venture to look up, but he saw the burning
flush that swept over her face, and, for the first time,
guessed the secret of her husband's gloom.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Mrs. Courtney," he said, gently, "there is
no explanation or apology needed.  I intended setting
out for Westport, to-morrow; but, now, since you will
not go, I will start this afternoon.  You will, most
probably, be gone before I return; and so, besides the formal
adieu I shall bid you up stairs, let me say farewell, now.
Should we never meet again, I hope you will sometimes
think of me as a friend."
</p>

<p>
He pressed her hand and passed up stairs; while
Laura ran to hide her burning cheeks, in the solitude of
her own room.
</p>

<p>
The dark, fierce glance of hatred, which Mr. Courtney
bestowed upon the captain, as he entered, confirmed him
in his opinion.  Pitying Laura, while he despised her
husband, he determined to positively neglect her, rather
than give him further cause for jealousy.
</p>

<p>
"You have left Lem waiting on the beach," said Sibyl,
some half-hour after his entrance.  "Is he to wait for
you, there?"
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!  I forgot all about him.  I ought to have
gone down, and told him to return.  I must go now,"
said Captain Campbell, starting up.
</p>

<p>
"No; ring the bell, and I will send Jenny down, to
tell him," said Mrs. Brantwell.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, I'll go," said Drummond, rising suddenly,
as he thought what an excellent opportunity this
would be, to deliver his note.  "I must be off, anyway,
and, I can just take the beach in my way."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said the young captain, resuming his
seat.  "Tell him I won't need his services, and he may
return home."
</p>

<p>
Making his adieu, Drummond hastened out and went
down to the beach, where Lem sat patiently sunning
himself on a log, and waiting for his master's return.
</p>

<p>
"Lem," said Drummond, as he reached him, "You
are to go back to the island without waiting for Captain
Campbell."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, marser," said the obedient Lem, starting up.
</p>

<p>
"And, Lem, I want you to do me a service."
</p>

<p>
"Berry well; I's willin'."
</p>

<p>
"I want you to carry a note from me to Miss
Christie."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sar," replied Lem, inwardly wondering what
the "ole 'oman" would say to this if she heard it.
</p>

<p>
"You are to give it to no one but herself&mdash;neither to
Mrs. Tom nor Carl; and you must not let any one see
you giving it either.  Why, where the deuce can it be?  I
surely have not lost it?"
</p>

<p>
All this time he had been searching in his pockets,
but the note was nowhere to be found.  He felt in his
vest-pocket, where he had placed it, then in his
coat-pockets, then back again to his vest.  All in vain.  The
note was gone!
</p>

<p>
"I must have dropped it on the way, confound it!" he
muttered, angrily.  "What if any one should find it?
But, luckily, if they do, there is no clew by which they
will discover me to be the writer.  Well, I must write
another, that is all."
</p>

<p>
He took a pencil from his pocket, tore a leaf out of
his tablet, and wrote a few lines.  Then he consigned
them to Lem, with the caution:
</p>

<p>
"Be sure you do not lose it, nor let any one see you
deliver it.  And this is for your trouble&mdash;and silence.
You understand?"
</p>

<p>
"Sartin, marse," said Lem, rolling up his eyes with a
volume of meaning; and he pocketed with unfeigned
delight the silver coin.  "I's dumb, and nobody'll see me
givin' Miss Christie dis.  Cotch a weasel asleep."
</p>

<p>
"All right, then; push off," said Drummond, as, with
a mind intensely relieved, he sprang up the bank, while
his messenger set off for the island.
</p>

<p>
Meantime we must return to the parsonage.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had Drummond gone, when Mrs. Courtney
entered, and took the seat he had just vacated beside
Sibyl.  Noticing Captain Campbell only by a grave bow&mdash;for
the watchful eyes of her husband were upon her&mdash;she
entered into a low-toned conversation with Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! she is growing careful; that is a bad sign.  I
must watch them more closely, now that they have
become guarded," thought Mr. Courtney, setting his
teeth hard.
</p>

<p>
And, while the captain remained, every word, every
look, every tone was watched and perverted by the
jealous husband.  Captain Campbell treated him with cool
contempt, and scarcely noticed him at all; but Laura
watched him constantly from under her long eye-lashes,
anxious and alarmed, as she noticed his ghastly face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I wish Captain Campbell would go&mdash;I wish he
would go," thought Laura, looking uneasily out of the
window, "Heaven help Edgar! the man is mad!"
</p>

<p>
Did some sweet instinct tell him her wish?  He rose
that instant to take his leave.
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;oh! by the way, Sibyl," he said, suddenly, as
he was departing, "I came near forgetting I had an
epistle for you.  This is it, I believe," he added, drawing a
note from his pocket, and going over to where slip and
Laura sat.
</p>

<p>
"For me?" said Sibyl, opening it.  "Who from, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Little Christie gave it to me as I was going."
</p>

<p>
"Christie?" cried Sibyl, in a voice that made them
start, as her eyes ran eagerly over the lines.  They were
as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR MISS SIBYL.&mdash;I did not tell you all that night.
I have thought since I should have done so.  When next
you visit the island I shall reveal to you my secret; for I
feel you have a right to know.  CHRISTIE."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Pale with many emotions, Sibyl leaned for a moment
against the window, without speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Sibyl, what awful revelation does that tiny
note contain, to alarm you so?" he asked, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Guy," she said, impatiently, starting up.  "I must
visit the island to-day."
</p>

<p>
"The island!  Nonsense, Sibyl!" broke in Mrs. Brantwell.
</p>

<p>
"I must&mdash;I must!  My business there will not admit
of delay.  I must go."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what's wrong?  They seemed all well when I
left," said her brother, still more surprised.
</p>

<p>
Feeling it would not do to excite a curiosity she could
not satisfy, Sibyl controlled her emotions, and said, more
calmly:
</p>

<p>
"They are well enough.  It is not that; but
circumstances render it necessary that I should go there to-day.
Who will take me over?"
</p>

<p>
"If you wait for an hour or two, Carl Henley will be
here.  I heard Mrs. Tom saying he would visit N&mdash;&mdash;
to-night, for things she wanted.  If you must go, he will
take you when he returns."
</p>

<p>
"Very well; I suppose that must do," said Sibyl,
controlling her burning impatience by a great effort, as she
hastily left the room.
</p>

<p>
And Captain Campbell, having made his adieus, also
departed, followed by Mrs. Brantwell.  Laura kept her
seat by the window, while her husband still scowled
gloomily from under his midnight brow.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this is certainly pleasant," thought Mrs. Courtney.
"What a prize I have drawn in the great matrimonial
lottery, to be sure.  Ugh!  I declare he looks like a
ghoul&mdash;a death's head&mdash;an ogre&mdash;a&mdash;I don't know what,
as he sits there, glaring at me in that hideous way.  That
man will be the death of me yet, I'm sure.  Positively I
must have committed some awful crime, some time or
other, to be punished with such a husband.  His mouth
looks as if it had been shut, and bolted, and locked, and the
key forever lost.  I wonder if he could open it.  I'll see."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Courtney," she said, facing round.
</p>

<p>
An inarticulate "<i>Well?</i>" came growlingly forth from
the compressed mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Look pleasant, can't you?  I declare, the very sight
of you is enough to make one's blood run cold."
</p>

<p>
"You would rather look at the gallant Captain
Campbell, perhaps!" he said, with an evil sneer.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I would then&mdash;there!  You don't see him wearing
such a diabolical, savage, cut-throat look as you do.
I wish to mercy you'd take him for a model, and not
make such a fright of yourself, I'm positively ashamed
to present you as my husband, of late&mdash;you have got to
be such a hideous-looking creature!"
</p>

<p>
He glanced at her, without speaking, until a circle of
white flamed around his eyes.  And now that Laura's by
no means angelic temper was roused, there is no telling
what she would not have said, had not Mrs. Brantwell's
voice been heard at that moment at the head of the
stairs, calling:
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Courtney&mdash;Mrs. Courtney, I want you a moment."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Courtney hastened from the room, and
Mr. Courtney was left alone with his evil passions.
</p>

<p>
As she rose from her seat, his eye fell on something
like a note under her chair.  Like a tiger pouncing on
his prey, he sprang upon it, seized it, opened it, read it,
and crushed it convulsively in his hand.
</p>

<p>
<i>It was Willard Drummond's lost note!</i>
</p>

<p>
"This is hers; she has dropped it.  <i>He</i> gave it to
her!" said the unhappy man his face growing absolutely
appalling in its ghastly pallor.  "Oh, I see it all&mdash;I see
it all!  They dare not meet in day-time, and she will
meet him this night on the isle.  Good Heaven!  I shall
go mad!  Dishonored, disgraced forever! and by the
woman I have loved so madly.  And she laughed, mocked,
and taunted me to my face, with this in her possession!"
</p>

<p>
He ground his teeth, to keep back the terrific groans
that were making their way up through his tortured heart.
</p>

<p>
And, as if sent by his evil demon, Laura entered at
that moment, laughing merrily at some jest she had left
behind.
</p>

<p>
He stood with his back to her, as if looking out of the
window.
</p>

<p>
"And is this the woman I have loved&mdash;this vilest of
her sex, who dare laugh with such a crime on her soul?
I know now&mdash;oh!  I know now, why she did not go to the
island with him, to-day.  She thought to blind me, and
make me think she was not going at all, that I might be
lulled into security.  Curses light on them both!" came
through his clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
Little dreaming of the thoughts that were passing
through his mind, Laura&mdash;ever the creature of
impulse&mdash;forgetting her momentary anger, went over, and, laying
her hand on his arm, said:
</p>

<p>
"Come, Mr. Courtney, throw off this gloom, and be a
little like you used to be.  There is no occasion for all
this anger, for, I am not going to the island, at all.  You
see, I have even given up my own, sweet will, to please
you; so, I think I deserve something in return, for being
so good.  Don't I?"
</p>

<p>
He turned, and she almost shrieked aloud, at the
awful face she beheld.
</p>

<p>
"Edgar!  Oh, Edgar!  Great Heaven! do not look
so wild.  I never meant to make you so angry.  I will
not go&mdash;indeed, I will not go.  Only speak to me, and do
not wear that dreadful look!"
</p>

<p>
And, pale, trembling, and terrified, she clung to his
arm.
</p>

<p>
With an awful malediction, he hurled her from him,
and sent her reeling across the room.
</p>

<p>
She struck against the sharp edge of the table, and
fell to the ground, her face covered with blood.
</p>

<p>
But he heeded her not.  Seizing his hat and coat, he
rushed from the house, as if driven by ten thousand
furies.  And his face, upturned to the light, was the face
of a demon.
</p>

<p>
Three hours later, a boat, containing two persons, put
off for Campbell's Isle.  One, was a rough fisher-boy,
half simpleton, half idiot; the other, a tall, dark man,
who sat in the stern, his hat drawn far down over his
brow, the collar of his coat turned up, leaving nothing to
be seen, but a pair of wild, black, maniac eyes, that glared
like live coals, with the fire of madness.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
THAT DAY.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "The day is lowering, stilly black,<br>
  Sleeps the grim wave."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Really, Sibyl, my love, you are getting to be a
most singular girl.  Two or three days ago
you were all in the dismals; then, after the party,
you got as amiable and bright as a June morning; and
scarcely had you promised to stay with me here for an
indefinite length of time, and I was congratulating myself
on having secured you here, when Guy brings you a tiny
note from this little blue-eyed island-girl, Christie, and
lo! you are off on the wing again, and I am left to go moping
about like a poor old hen-turkey with the distemper."
</p>

<p>
"But my dear Mrs. Brantwell," said Sibyl, "you have
Mrs. Courtney, who is twice as agreeable and lively a
companion as I am.  It's impossible for you to go
moping around, as you say, when she is here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Mrs. Brantwell, "that's all very fine,
without being in the least consoling.  I want you.
Mrs. Courtney's very lively and all that, I know; but I invited
her here as much to keep you in spirits as anything else,
and now you fly off and leave us for my pains."
</p>

<p>
"I am very sorry, Mrs. Brantwell, to disturb your
amusements," said Sibyl, gravely; "but when I tell you
this affair is of the utmost importance to me, and that my
happiness, in a measure, depends upon my going, I am
sure you will withdraw your objections."
</p>

<p>
"Your happiness?  Now, Sibyl Campbell, I would just
like to know what this island-girl has to do with <i>your</i>
happiness?" said Mrs. Brantwell, folding her fat hands, and
looking in Sibyl's face.
</p>

<p>
"More than you would ever think, perhaps&mdash;more
than I once ever dreamed myself she would have," said
Sibyl, while a cloud fell over her brow.  "But enough of
this.  I cannot explain further at present.  The amount of
it is, I must go to-night!"
</p>

<p>
And Sibyl's face assumed that look of steady decision
it could sometimes wear.
</p>

<p>
"Humph! particularly mysterious all this.  When do
you return?"
</p>

<p>
"That depends upon circumstances.  To-morrow, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, do you know what I think?" said Mrs. Brantwell,
with such abrupt suddenness that the young girl
started.
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed; I do not pretend to divination," she
said, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I tell you?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please.  I am all attention."
</p>

<p>
"And you will not be angry with your old friend, who
talks for your good?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not.  What in the world is this preface
about?"
</p>

<p>
And Sibyl's large eyes were fixed surprised on the fair,
florid face of the matron.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, Sibyl, it's my opinion you're jealous of
some one," said the old lady, with the air of one who has
made a discovery.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl's dark face flushed, and then grew very pale.
</p>

<p>
"And that's a very miserable feeling, my dear," said
Mrs. Brantwell, composedly, "and also very foolish.  No
sensible person ever gives way to it, because they only
bestow their affections on those in whom they can place
implicit trust.  Now, I hope you have too much good
sense to fancy Mr. Drummond can care for any one in
this world more than you."
</p>

<p>
Sibyl sat with her face averted, and made no reply.
</p>

<p>
"I had too high an opinion of you, Sibyl," went on the
old lady, very gravely, "to think you could stoop to be
jealous of any one, much less an insignificant little girl
like this Christie.  Don't be angry, my love; I am talking
for your good.  And indeed you have not the slightest
cause to fear a rival; for, go where you will, you cannot
find one more peerlessly beautiful than yourself.  I
don't say this to make you vain&mdash;though I know you, my
queenly darling, could never be vain&mdash;but it is to inspire
you with confidence.  Come, my dear child, shake off this
feeling that is unworthy of you.  Mr. Drummond, I feel
assured, has never for an instant wavered in his fidelity
to you."
</p>

<p>
"Who said I was jealous?" said Sibyl, passionately.
"I am not.  He <i>dare</i> not be false to me.  Let him try it
at his peril.  He knows I am not one to be trifled with."
</p>

<p>
"Why, my dear, your very vehemence convinced me
of what I only suspected before.  I am afraid you will be
very unhappy, Sibyl, if you indulge in such feelings.
You ought to try and cultivate a more trusting spirit, my
dear; without perfect faith in the person we love, there
can be no happiness.
</p>

<p>
"I do trust!  I <i>do</i> trust!  I <i>will</i> trust!" said Sibyl,
clenching her small hand as though she would in a like
manner shut out all doubt from her heart.  "But, oh, where
we love, the faintest symptom of distrust is madness."
</p>

<p>
"Where we love truly we feel no distrust, Sibyl."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you do not know.  Do I not love truly?  Have
I not staked life, and heart, and happiness on him, and
yet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You doubt."
</p>

<p>
"No, no&mdash;not now.  I did doubt, but that time
has gone," said Sibyl, with a sort of incoherence.
</p>

<p>
"Then, wherefore this visit to the isle, Sibyl?" said
Mrs. Brantwell, fixing her eyes searchingly on her face.
</p>

<p>
Before Sibyl could reply, a sound, as if of a heavy
fall below, reached their ears.
</p>

<p>
"What can that be?" said Mrs. Brantwell, starting up.
</p>

<p>
"It sounded like some one falling," said Sibyl, listening
breathlessly.  "I will go down and see."
</p>

<p>
She flew down the long staircase, followed by
Mrs. Brantwell; and, on entering the room, there they found
Mrs. Courtney lying senseless on the floor, her face
deluged with blood.
</p>

<p>
"Great Heavens! what has happened!" said Sibyl,
turning faint and sick at the sight.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know," said Mrs. Brantwell, wildly, as she
hurried forward and raised the slender, prostrate form.
"Oh, that demon of jealousy!  How many souls is it
destined to torture?  Sibyl, please ring the bell."
</p>

<p>
"But what does this mean?  I do not understand,"
said Sibyl, as she obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"Why, this poor child's husband is crazy with jealousy&mdash;I
have observed it, though she thought I did not."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven be merciful! he cannot have struck her?"
said Sibyl, white with horror.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do not know; but jealousy will make a man
do anything&mdash;commit murder.  It has done it before now,
and will again.  Jenny," she said, as the mulatto servant
entered, "tell Tom to go instantly for the doctor, and
then come back and help me to carry this poor lady up
stairs."
</p>

<p>
The alarmed girl flew to obey; and after dispatching
the boy for the doctor, hurried back and aided
Mrs. Brantwell in conveying the slight form of Mrs. Courtney
to her room.
</p>

<p>
Then, with some tepid water, she washed off the
blood and disclosed a deep gash right above the eye,
which continued bleeding so profusely as to awaken fears
for her life.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I fear she will bleed to death!  Would that the
doctor were here!" said Mrs. Brantwell, wringing her
hands in deepest distress.
</p>

<p>
"And here he is," said Sibyl, as at that moment the
doctor hastily entered.
</p>

<p>
After examining the wound the doctor pronounced it
dangerous, but not fatal, and soon succeeded in stopping
the bleeding.  And then the dark eyes of Laura opened
wildly, and wandered with a vague, frightened look
around.
</p>

<p>
"My poor child, what has happened?" said Mrs. Brantwell,
bending over her, and parting the bright
disordered hair on her pale brow.
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?" she said, grasping Mrs. Brantwell's
arm, convulsively.
</p>

<p>
"Who, love?" said Mrs. Brantwell, gently.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he&mdash;Mr. Courtney," she said, in the same
frightened whisper.
</p>

<p>
"He is gone, dear.  Did he strike you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!&mdash;no, no!" she cried, wildly.  "I fell, and
struck against something.  Oh, my head!  I am going
crazy, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, love!  You must not excite yourself.  Lie
still, and do not talk."
</p>

<p>
"I have been very wicked&mdash;very rash," she said, "but,
I did not mean it.  Oh, I never meant it&mdash;I never&mdash;never
meant it!" she moaned, pressing her hands over her
heart.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest child, I know it.  But it will hurt you to
talk so much."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes; I always did talk thoughtlessly, and it has
driven him mad.  Oh!  I loved him once, and I have
driven him mad, now," she cried, wringing her pale fingers.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Brantwell looked at the puzzled doctor in
deepest distress.
</p>

<p>
"Give her this; it will compose her," said that gentleman,
who could not tell what to make of all this.
</p>

<p>
"Drink this, love; it will soothe you," said that good
lady, raising the poor, wounded head of the young wife,
and holding the cup to her lips.
</p>

<p>
With the passive obedience of a child, she complied,
and fell back on her pillow.  And, gradually, the wild,
frenzied expression left her face, and she fell into a deep
slumber.
</p>

<p>
"And now, she must be kept very quiet," said the
doctor, as he took his hat and gloves.  "There is not the
slightest danger, if she is not allowed to excite herself,
and is carefully nursed, which I know she will be, with
Mrs. Brantwell.  Repeat the medicine, when she wakes,
and I will call again, to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
And the doctor bowed himself out, while Mrs. Brantwell
sat down beside the poor, pale sleeper, fanning her
gently, and watching her while she slept.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl, seeing her presence was not necessary, went
down to the parlor, where she found Willard Drummond
awaiting her.  She started in alarm, for his countenance
was grave and deeply troubled.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Willard, what has happened?".  she asked, hurriedly,
quick to take the alarm, where he was concerned.
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl," he said, slowly, "I am obliged to leave you."
</p>

<p>
She turned deadly pale, and her large, dark eyes were
fixed on his face, in agonized inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"Scarce an hour ago, I received a letter from home,"
he went on, "saying, that my father was at the point of
death, and, if I ever wished to see him again, I must
hasten there, immediately.  I have not a moment to lose.
I start instantly; but first, I have come to take leave of
you."
</p>

<p>
The news came so suddenly, that, for a moment she
seemed stunned.
</p>

<p>
"When do you return?" she said, in a voice faint with
emotion.
</p>

<p>
"Soon, I hope; but, I cannot, as yet, tell.  Farewell,
my own, dearest love; believe me, I will return to you
as soon as may be."
</p>

<p>
"And you will write?" she said, burying her face in
his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Sibyl&mdash;that will be my first care.
Remember me to our friends, and explain to them the cause of
this abrupt departure.  And now, once more, adieu."
</p>

<p>
He pressed her to his heart, and then quitted the
house, and, mounting his horse, rode rapidly away.
</p>

<p>
Once he paused, and looked anxiously in the direction
of the isle.  He thought of Christie receiving his note,
and waiting for him in vain, at their lonely,
trysting-place.
</p>

<p>
"What will she think of my absence?" he mused;
"for, I know, poor, faithful child, she will await my
coming there, until morning dawn.  What cause will she
assign for my not keeping my appointment?  Well, I
cannot help it.  I dare not wait until morning; and she
will hear to-morrow, why I was absent."
</p>

<p>
And he rode on, never thinking whether Christie was
destined to live to see that eventful tomorrow, dawn.
</p>

<p>
When he was gone, Sibyl sat for a few moments, with
a feeling of utter desolation.  She knew he was not to be
gone long; but, it was their first parting, save the few
days she was absent in New York, and there was a dreary
sense of loneliness&mdash;a passionate longing to be with him,
to never leave him&mdash;filling her heart.  With her hands
lying upon the table, and her head dropped upon them,
she remained wholly unconscious of the flight of time,
until the entrance of Mrs. Brantwell, aroused her.
</p>

<p>
She lifted her head and tried to listen, as the good old
lady spoke of Laura.
</p>

<p>
"She has had a quiet sleep, and now appears much
better.  But how pale you are, Sibyl!  Are you going to
be ill, too?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I am quite well; only it gave me such a shock,
it was so sudden," said Sibyl, pressing her hands to her
throbbing brow.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I don't wonder at it," said Mrs. Brantwell,
thinking the shock she alluded to, was the sudden sight of
Laura.  "I came to look for a sponge, and must go back
to Mrs. Courtney, now."
</p>

<p>
She left the room, and Sibyl went to the window, and
looked out.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon was waning, the sun was slowly sinking
toward the west, and, Sibyl saw, with some concern,
that a dark, dense cloud was rising.
</p>

<p>
"There is a storm coming, and perhaps there may be
no boat from the island, after all," she said, anxiously.
"How can I wait until to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
But, even while she spoke, she espied the well-known
form of Carl Henley, approaching the house.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl sprang to the bell, and rang a peal, that
presently brought Jenny.
</p>

<p>
"Jenny, run down to the door, and tell the boy you
will see passing to come up here immediately," she said,
excitedly.
</p>

<p>
Jennie disappeared, and soon returned with Master
Carl looking considerably amazed, not to say frightened,
at this unexpected summons.
</p>

<p>
"Carl, what time do you return to the island?" asked
Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
"Right off&mdash;soon's ever I get some tea, and sugar, and
coffee, and starch, and things for Aunt Tom."
</p>

<p>
"Will you take me over when you are going, Carl?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes'm, if you'll not be long getting ready; 'cause
there's a storm a comin', an' no matter how hard I pull,
it'll be dark afore we get there," said Carl.
</p>

<p>
"I will be ready in five minutes, and wait for you on
the beach.  That will do," said Sibyl, rising, to close the
interview.
</p>

<p>
Carl hurried out to fulfill his commissions for Mrs. Tom,
and Sibyl went to her room to dress, and take leave
of Mrs. Brantwell.
</p>

<p>
"Self-willed&mdash;self-willed!" said the good old lady,
sorrowfully, as she kissed her.  "Well, good-by, my love.
Remember, I half expect you back to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"And I shall certainly try not to disappoint you," said
Sibyl, as she quitted the room.
</p>

<p>
She took her way to the beach, where she was soon
joined by Carl, who, muttering an inarticulate something
about having a "stunner of a storm pretty soon," pushed
off and took the oars, and under his practiced hands the
boat was soon flying like a bird through the sparkling
waves.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
WHAT CAME NEXT.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "And on the midnight air arose<br>
  That awful dying cry,<br>
  That echoed through the lonely house<br>
  Vibrating to the sky."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The sky was rapidly darkening.  The wind came
wailing with a low, menacing sound over the waters.
The sun sank red, fiery, and threatening in the far west,
and the scared water-fowl went skimming over the
troubled face of the bay, sending full, wild shrieks, as if
to herald the coming storm.  The darkened sea heaved
and tossed, as if struggling with an inward foe, and the
little boat quivered in every joint as it flew over the
glassy waves.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl's eyes kindled as they surveyed the grand but
terrible beauty of the scene.  On the east, as far as the
eye could see, spread out the boundless, tempestuous
ocean; on the west stretched a long line of coast, forming
a sort of semi-circle, lost on one side in the dense
primeval forest, that as yet the woodman's axe had not
desecrated, and on the other jutting out in a wild, rocky
promontory.  On the south was the island, which they
were now approaching, looking a mere dark speck in the
vast and mighty deep.
</p>

<p>
"If we don't have a screamer of a storm to-night you
may say I don't know nuthing 'bout the weather," said
Carl, pausing for a moment to wipe the perspiration off
his heated brow, and glance at the darkening face of the
sky.  "Such a one as we ain't had since the night me
and Mr. Drummond and Lem saved the man and
woman what was washed ashore from the wreck."
</p>

<p>
"That was an awful night," said Sibyl, still keeping
her kindling eyes fixed on the gloomy grandeur of the
sea and sky, "but how splendid, how magnificent, how
glorious this prospect is.  Oh, I <i>love</i> a storm.  I love the
grand jubilee of the earth, when sea, and wind, and
lightning, and storm, all join in the glorious hymn of the
tempest.  Oh, the nights that I have spent on sea when
nothing was to be seen but the black pall of the heavens
above, rent every instant by the forked lightning, while
the crash of the thunder, and the roar of the wind and
waves mingled together in the sublime refrain, and our
ship went driving on, as if mad.  Oh, for those nights
again! when my very soul was inspired by the unspeakable
glory of the scene."
</p>

<p>
Her wild eyes shone and flashed like stars, and her
cheeks flushed with the impetuosity with which she spoke.
</p>

<p>
She was not addressing Carl, she was not thinking of
him, she did not even see him; her whole soul, and heart,
and mind, were filled with the present scene, and the
remembrance of those she had seen.
</p>

<p>
Carl stared for an instant at the wild girl, wondering
if she had gone mad, but Sibyl recovered from her
momentary trance, and asked, quietly:
</p>

<p>
"Do you think we will reach the island before the
storm bursts?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I guess so.  We'll be there in 'bout ten minutes
now.  Oh, by granny, here it comes!"
</p>

<p>
A low, sullen rumbling, the herald of the coming
storm, was heard, and two large, heavy drops of rain fell
pattering on the thwart.
</p>

<p>
"Lor' sakes! ef the squall comes now we'll go to the
bottom for sartin," said Carl, pulling with the energy of
desperation, until the perspiration stood in great globules
on his brow.
</p>

<p>
But the storm, as if in pity for that frail bark and its
inmates, held up a few moments longer, and Carl uttered
a yell of triumph, as he shot into a little natural harbor,
sheltered by overhanging rocks, immediately below the
lodge.
</p>

<p>
"Let the storm come," he cried, waving his cap in
exultation; "we're all right as a trivet now."
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke his last words were lost in the roar
of the wind and sea.
</p>

<p>
Safe and sheltered as it was in the little cove, the boat
quivered for an instant, like a reed in the blast, before the
first furious crash of the storm.  Had it burst upon them
a few moments sooner they would instantaneously have
been swamped.  But Carl, bending before the furious
gale, drove his stanch little craft ashore in triumph and
sprang out, followed by Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
The rain was falling heavily, and the wind blew so
furiously, driving it in her face, that for the first moment
she shrank back, and was forced to grasp a projecting
rock to prevent herself from being blown backward.  The
next instant her dauntless spirit returned, and, raising
her head, she shook the rain from her dripping locks, and
sprang up the rocks with the fearless agility of a young
mountain-kid, until she stood at the door of Campbell's
Lodge, her ancestral home.
</p>

<p>
All the front of the house was dark and cheerless, for
Aunt Moll never visited the front chambers when the
family were absent.  Pushing open the hall-door, which
was never locked, Sibyl, accustomed to the way from
earliest childhood, passed through the hall to the door
leading to the kitchen, while the old house shook to its
center, and every window rattled in the furious blast of
the storm.  The very chimneys shook as though they
would fall and annihilate them, when Sibyl opened the
door, and, wet, dripping like a mermaid rising from the
sea-foam, she stood before her two astonished servants.
</p>

<p>
There was a bright fire roaring cheerily up the wide
chimney, for, summer or winter, Aunt Moll insisted on
having a fire; and over this, the affrighted old woman
crouched, mumbling strange prayers and invocations for
mercy, and fairly gray with terror.  Lem, little less
alarmed, sat in a remote corner, keeping his eyes tightly
shut, to exclude the blinding glare of the vivid flashes of
lightning.
</p>

<p>
At the sudden and startling opening of the door, both
looked up, and beholding their young mistress, whom
they supposed safe at the parsonage, standing before
them, her wild, black hair streaming in disorder down
her back, Aunt Moll uttered a piercing shriek, and,
springing to her feet, rushed over and threw herself into
Lem's arms, with the cry:
</p>

<p>
"Ah, it's a ghos'! it's a ghos'!  Oh, Lem, sabe yer
poor, ole mudder!  It's our young missus' ghos'!"
</p>

<p>
And, terror-stricken, Aunt Moll clung shrieking to
Lem, who stood unable to speak, his teeth chattering
with terror.
</p>

<p>
The scene was so ridiculous&mdash;Aunt Moll's terror, and
Lem's frightened face and distended eyeballs&mdash;that Sibyl,
throwing herself into a seat, could scarcely refrain from
laughter.
</p>

<p>
At this, Aunt Moll ceased her shrieks, and looked up,
and Lem looked at her in utter bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"It's our young Miss Sibyl, herself," ventured Lem,
at last.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course it is," said Sibyl, as soon as she could
speak, for laughter.  "Come, Aunt Moll, I'm no more of
a ghost than you are yourself.  Don't look so terribly
afraid of me."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl, <i>is</i> it you?" said Aunt Moll, beginning
cautiously to approach, and eying her askance.  "Well,
I 'clare to gracious, ef I didn't t'ink 'twas your ghos', Miss
Sibyl!" said Aunt Moll, drawing a deep breath.  "What
could take you out sich a stormy night?"
</p>

<p>
"Carl Henley's boat, brought me here; I wanted to
see you and Lem, Aunt Moll.  And now, Lem, go and
make a fire in my bed-room, to air it; I am going to stay
here, all night."
</p>

<p>
"S'pect you'll have to.  Should like to know who
could go out ag'in dis night.  Oh, Lor' a massy-sakes! jist
listen to dat, will yer!" said Aunt Moll, trembling
and shrinking, as another furious blast made the old
house shake.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's a terrible night.  Heaven grant there may
be no wrecks on the coast!" said Sibyl, thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"An' now, honey, when de fire's made in yer room,
yer mus' go up an' take off'n your wet clothes, else you'll
catch your deff o' cole.  An' I'll get yer supper, cause yer
mus' be hungry," said Aunt Moll, approaching the
fireplace.
</p>

<p>
But at that instant, a vivid flash of lightning blazed
down the wide chimney, and old Moll sprang back, with
a yell.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lor'! who ebber did see de like o' dat!  S'pect
it t'ought it had me dat time; but I ain't cotched yet!"
said the old woman, quaking in terror.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't mind, Aunt Moil; I do not care for anything,"
said Sibyl.  "And here comes Lem; so I will go
to my room."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Miss Sibyl, may I go too?  'Deed an' 'deed, I is
'feared to stay here!" said Aunt Moll, in trembling tones,
as she listened to the roaring, howling, shrieking of the
wild storm without.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Aunt Moll, if you think you will be any
safer with me, you are welcome to come.  But your trust
should be placed in a higher power.  He who rules the
storm alone can help you," said Sibyl, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss Sibyl, I knows all dat, an' I does trus' in
Providence; but, 'pears like I'd feel safer ef I was with
you.  Seems like de danger wouldn't be so near, nor so
drefful," said Aunt Moll; "an' I allers was awfully
skeered o' lightnin'."
</p>

<p>
"Very well; come, then," said Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
And Aunt Moll, glad of the permission, lit a candle,
and preceded Sibyl through the hall, and up the polished
oaken stairs, at a shuffling trot, leaving Lem, much against
his will, sole possessor of the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
There was a bright fire burning on the hearth, which
the damp, unused rooms required, rendering the
flickering tallow candle superfluous.
</p>

<p>
"Now, where are you going to sleep, Aunt Moll?"
said Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
"Here on de floor, honey; I'll bring in de mattrass,
an' spread it here afore de fire."
</p>

<p>
Sibyl assented to this arrangement; and, lifting the
blind, seated herself by the window to watch the storm.
But Aunt Moll coming in, held up her hands in
speechless terror at her hardihood.
</p>

<p>
"Settin' at de winder, an' it a lightnin'!" she
exclaimed.  "Miss Sibyl, honey, dat's de mos' recklesses
thing to do as eber was.  Put down de curtain, chile, an'
go to bed; it's a temptin' o' de Lor', dat ar."
</p>

<p>
"There's no danger, Aunt Moll," said Sibyl; "it is just
as safe here as in bed."
</p>

<p>
"But it ain't, chile; you doesn't know.  It's wrong,
and likewise sinful, to sit down a lookin' at de storm,"
persisted the old woman.
</p>

<p>
But Sibyl, without paying the slightest attention, still
sat gazing out, while Aunt Moll from entreating took to
scolding, which was likewise unheeded.
</p>

<p>
"Hold your tongue, Aunt Moll!" said her young mistress,
at last, impatiently facing round, tired of hearing
the garrulous old woman.
</p>

<p>
And at this unprecedented rebuke, Aunt Moll sat
down before the fire in mortified silence.
</p>

<p>
Though burning with feverish impatience to meet
Christie, and learn what meaning lay couched in her
mysterious note, Sibyl found herself forced to wait until
morning.  The storm seemed steadily increasing, the
wind raved wildly, shaking every beam in the old house,
and the booming of the sea on the rocks was deafening.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was the wildly shrieking tempest, the appalling
crash of the angry elements, but an unaccountable
depression weighed on Sibyl's spirits&mdash;a creeping feeling
of horror that no effort could shake off.  She strove to
rouse herself, to reason herself out of the superstitious
dread that was overwhelming her, but in vain.  A nameless
terror had clutched her heart, and would not relax
its hold.
</p>

<p>
And so the hours wore on, and midnight approached.
And the storm without seemed to have shrieked and
roared, and worn itself hoarse, and was at last relapsing
into sullen silence.  The fire on the hearth was burning
low, and casting wild and fantastic shadows through the
gloomy room.  Aunt Moll lay in that deep, deathlike
sleep which only those of her race enjoy, and her deep
breathing sounded audibly through the room.
</p>

<p>
Exhausted with the excitement of the storm and her
own thoughts, Sibyl rose and prepared herself for bed,
hoping in sleep to lose the strange feeling that was
overpowering her.
</p>

<p>
She lay down, but she wooed the drowsy god in vain.
Sleep would not come at her call.  So she tossed from
side to side, wishing&mdash;vaguely, wildly&mdash;morning would
come, and listening to the dreary beat of the waves on
the shore.
</p>

<p>
A death-like silence reigned within the old house,
while the storm without was still sullenly grumbling.
</p>

<p>
It was near midnight, and Sibyl lay with her hands
clasped over her forehead, when suddenly she heard the
front door burst violently open, and through the silent
house arose the wild, terrific, appalling shriek of
"Murder!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
THAT NIGHT.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Come, madness! come with me, senseless death!<br>
  I cannot suffer this!  Here, rocky wall,<br>
  Scatter these brains, or dull them!"&mdash;DE MONTFORD.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
About an hour before the storm burst upon the
island, Edgar Courtney, the victim of his own
diabolical passions, reached it unseen and unobserved.
"You will await my return here," he said, as he was
moving away.  "I must be back in N&mdash;&mdash; before morning."
</p>

<p>
"Don't know 'bout that," said the boy who had taken
him over; "there's an awful storm rising; but if you
ain't afeared to venture, I ain't."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Courtney glanced at the dark, sullen sky, but
what was the storm without compared with the storm
within?  Leave the island he must before morning, so he
replied:
</p>

<p>
"I must go back, let it storm as it will.  You can
remain here sheltered under these rocks till I come back."
</p>

<p>
And wrapping his cloak around him, he moved
swiftly away, and concealed himself behind some
overhanging trees to await the result.
</p>

<p>
The spot where he stood commanded a view of the sea
on all sides.  And, therefore, when in the deepening
gloom, some hours after, he saw a boat approach the isle,
containing the form of a woman, he had not a single
doubt as to who that woman was.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the demoniac look that his face wore at that
instant!  His face upturned to the bleak light was that of
a fiend.
</p>

<p>
Blinded by his passions, he did not observe, as in a
calmer moment he might have done, even in the gloom,
the difference between this tall figure and that of his wife.
He only saw a woman landing on the isle, springing up
the rocks, and disappearing in the darkness, and who but
Laura would have ventured to the isle that stormy night.
</p>

<p>
When the night fell in more than Egyptian darkness,
accompanied by wind, and lightning, and rain, he made
his way blindly through it all to the trysting-place; and,
sheltered behind a friendly rock, he crouched down like a
panther waiting for its prey.
</p>

<p>
"She will not come in this storm&mdash;she cannot; you
will wait in vain," said the voice of Reason, faintly trying
to make itself heard.
</p>

<p>
"She will come&mdash;she will!" said Jealousy.  "She has
braved the storm to come to the island; and, though fire
should fall from heaven, she will keep her tryst.
Wait! wait! and you will have your revenge."
</p>

<p>
And the demon voice conquered.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Meantime, how went the night in the widow's cottage?
</p>

<p>
When&mdash;wet, dripping, soaked through&mdash;Carl reached
the cottage, his first care was to change his wet clothes,
and seat himself at the table, where a smoking supper
awaited him.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom held up her hands in wonder and
amazement when she heard that Sibyl had braved all that
furious storm to come to the isle.
</p>

<p>
"The girl must be clean crazy," she ejaculated, "to
venture on the stormy sea such a night!  I do wonder,
though, what brought Miss Sibyl here to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Dunno," said Carl, speaking with his mouth full of
griddle-cake.  "She was talking sort o' crazy in the boat.
'Spect' she thought that Mr. Drummond was here."
</p>

<p>
Christie, whose white fingers were, as usual, flying
busily, as she plied her needle, suddenly flushed to the
temples, and then grew paler than before.  She knew
what had brought Sibyl to the island, though she had
hardly fancied she would have ventured out in such a
storm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wish it had been clear to-night!" she thought,
lifting her head, and listening anxiously to the howling
tempest.
</p>

<p>
Lem, true to his promise, had faithfully delivered
Drummond's note to Christie unobserved.  But would he
come in all this storm?
</p>

<p>
Some vague rumor had reached her ear that Miss
Campbell, the beauty and heiress, was soon to be the
bride of Willard Drummond.  She did not believe it; it
was too monstrous, too dreadful; the bare possibility of
such a thing was maddening.  But Sibyl loved him, and
might cherish hopes that could never be realized; and
Christie felt it her duty, despite her promise, to put an
end to all these hopes, once and forever, by proclaiming
their marriage.  Therefore, she had seized the first
opportunity, and sent the note before mentioned by Captain
Campbell.
</p>

<p>
By this time Carl Henley had dispatched his supper;
and laboring under a vague impression that some one
would be in presently to carry him off by force, as
Mr. Drummond had done on a previous occasion, he made a
hasty exit up the ladder to bed, firmly resolving not to go
out again, though Aunt Tom should pull every hair out
of his head.
</p>

<p>
And when he was gone, Mrs. Tom, having secured
the windows and doors, drew up her wheel, and sat down
to spin.  And Christie, with cheeks flushed, and eyes
bright with anxiety and impatience, sewed on in silence,
replying vaguely and at random to the stream of
smalltalk kept up by Mrs. Tom.
</p>

<p>
There were many anxious thoughts passing through
the mind of the young girl.  Why had Willard been
absent for so long a time?&mdash;why had he appointed this
strange midnight meeting?&mdash;would he venture on the sea
in night and storm; and, if he came, what could his visit
and note portend?  His manner had changed so of late,
that, in spite of herself, the conviction that he already
repented of his hasty marriage forced itself upon her with
a pang like the bitterness of death.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I might have known," was her inward cry,
"that he, so rich, so handsome, possessing the love of one
so beautiful as Sibyl Campbell, could never be content
with poor little me!  Oh, I might have known he would
tire of me; but I was crazed, and believed all he told me.
Something warned me it would, sooner or later, come to
this; but now that it <i>has</i> come, it does not make it any
easier to bear."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the voice of Mrs. Tom, at this instant
breaking upon her reverie, as she stopped her wheel with
a jerk and looked sharply into Christie's face&mdash;"I would
like to know what's got into you to-night!  Here I've
asked you three blessed times to hand me that there
gownd, an' you don't mind me any more than if I was the
cat.  S'pose it's the latest fashion not to answer your
elders when they speak to you?  What is the matter with
the gal?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't hear you," faltered Christie, turning scarlet;
"my head aches.  Please excuse me; I didn't mean to
offend."
</p>

<p>
"Better go to bed, then, if you head aches.  Time we
was all in bed, for that matter.  No use sittin' up a-wastin'
of candles, when we can get up airly in the morning jist
as well.  Gemimi! how it blows!" said Mrs. Tom, as she
slipped the bands off her wheel and carried it over to its
accustomed corner.
</p>

<p>
Glad of the permission, Christie arose and began
arranging her bed on the wooden settle in the kitchen,
where she slept.  And Mrs. Tom, who preferred sleeping
by herself, sought her own couch, where, by the combined
effects of a light heart and a clear conscience, she was
soon in the land of dreams.
</p>

<p>
Relieved of the presence of the inquisitive old lady
Christie wrapped herself in her mantle, tied on her hood,
and softly opened the door.  The storm was at its height,
and the sudden entrance of a rush of wind and rain, sent
all the loose articles lying about, whirling through the
room.
</p>

<p>
It was awful to venture out in such a storm; but, had
the tempest raged twice as wildly, the faithful, loving
child-wife would have braved it all, to meet him, she
loved.
</p>

<p>
Exerting all her strength, she closed the door after her
without arousing the sleepers, and quitted the house she
was never destined to enter more.
</p>

<p>
On&mdash;through the falling rain, the driving wind, the
vivid lightning&mdash;she plunged, making her way blindly
through it all.  It was well she knew the road she was
traversing, and could pursue her way as well at midnight
as at noonday, or she would never have been able to
follow that tortuous, rocky path.
</p>

<p>
But, shrinking, and blinded by the rain, at times she
was forced to stop and cover her face in her mantle; and
anon, at some more furious blast that would have whirled
her away as though she had been a feather, she grasped
some projecting rock or tree, to protect herself from
being blown over the crags; but still she toiled on to her
destination.
</p>

<p>
"Will he be there?" she said, wildly.  "Oh, if after
all he should not come!  It seems madness, for me to
expect him in such a storm; but, if he should, it would
never do for me to be absent.  Oh, saints in heaven! what
lightning," she said, as pale with terror, she hid her
face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
But there was no time to pause&mdash;even now, he might
be waiting for her, on the beach; and still, on through
night, and rain, and storm she pressed, until at last,
drenched, dripping, and totally exhausted, she gained the
wet, slippery beach.
</p>

<p>
Half dead, with cold and exhaustion, she sank on a
rock, and cowered beneath the pitiless blast.  The dull
booming of the waves near sent a thrill of nameless awe
and horror, into her very soul.
</p>

<p>
She could not long sit there, exposed to the peltings
of the storm; so, wrapping her mantle still more closely
around her, she rose with a shiver, and strove to pierce
through the thick darkness, in search of that loved form.
</p>

<p>
In vain!  The gloom of Hades could not be deeper
than that which enveloped every object.
</p>

<p>
But, at that instant, there came a flash of lightning,
illuminating, for a single moment, with a blue, unearthly
glare, the bleak, slippery shingle, and revealing the black,
heaving sea, with its foam-crested billows.  Nothing
more.  As far as she could strain her eyes, no living
thing but herself, stood on the shore.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why does he not come?" was her heart's agonized
cry.  "Does he not know, in spite of storm and
tempest, I am awaiting him here?"
</p>

<p>
Another flash of lightning, revealing the dark, deserted
beach, the wildly shrieking ocean, and a pair of gleaming,
serpent-like eyes, watching from behind a rock, revealing
the slight, delicate form of a female standing alone
on the shore.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he will not come!  I know it!  Shall I stay here
longer, or shall I go home!" thought Christie, in an
agony of doubt.
</p>

<p>
Still another lurid blaze of flame!  And now, looking
up, she uttered a cry of joy; for the tall figure of a man,
wrapped in a cloak, was seen descending the rocks,
coming toward her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he is here! he is here!" was her joyful cry.
"Dearest, dearest Willard!  I knew you would come!"  And
springing forward she threw herself into his arms.
</p>

<p>
He did not speak&mdash;he did not move&mdash;only he drew a
step back and folded his arms over his breast.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Willard!  I feared you would not come; but,
oh!  I am so glad you are with me once more!"  And her
encircling arms clasped him closer, while her sunny head
sank on his breast.
</p>

<p>
With the storm within and the storm without, he
heard not, heeded not the name of Willard.  But another
flash of heaven's fire showed him a slight, slender form,
with the shining, golden hair of his faithless wife.
</p>

<p>
And now, for the first time, she noticed his strange
silence; and lifted her sweet face in surprise, saying:
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?  Why do you not speak to me?
What have I done?  Oh, I am so sorry, if I have angered
you.  What, what have I done?  Oh, indeed, I love you
more than life!"
</p>

<p>
His teeth closed together with a galvanic snap, his
eyes were like two living coals set in a ghastly skull, and
his hand clutched something within the folds of his
cloak with a convulsive grasp.
</p>

<p>
And still she clung to him, and still he maintained
that strange silence.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me what I have done?  Speak to me, or I shall
die!" she cried out, in anguish and terror.  "Oh, indeed, I
love you better than any one in the world!  I would die
sooner than offend you!"
</p>

<p>
"Die, then!" fairly shrieked the maddened man; "die,
since your own lips have proclaimed your guilt!"  And
clutching her fiercely by the throat, he plunged the
hidden knife into her side.
</p>

<p>
One piercing, terrific shriek, and she sank writhing,
quivering at his feet in mortal agony.  And the wretched
maniac above her unable to speak, or move, or think,
with distending eyeballs, glazing eyes&mdash;his ghastly face
like that of the dead&mdash;his trembling hands red with her
life-blood&mdash;stood rooted to the ground, caring not, feeling
not the furious storm now.
</p>

<p>
Was she dead?  Would that wild, appalling shriek be
repeated?  He listened, palsied with horror.  Naught met
his ear but the shrieking of the warring elements.
</p>

<p>
Just at that instant there came a blaze of lightning, as
though heaven and earth were on fire, and he beheld that
little, child-like form lying stiff and rigid at his feet, the
head fallen back; the blue lips parted, as if from them
the quivering soul had taken its flight; the arms lying
limp and lifeless by her side; the bright, golden hair,
half shading, the cold, beautiful face, on which the
pitiless rain wildly beat.
</p>

<p>
All his jealousy, his hatred, passed away with that
pitiful sight; and the passionate love, the adoring
worship his heart had first felt for her returned like a
swelling flood.  The memory of the time when she had left
home, and friends, and all, to fly with him&mdash;when she
had first been his loved and loving bride&mdash;bright, happy,
and beautiful&mdash;came back in overwhelming force.  And
now she was dead&mdash;dead by his hand!
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Heaven! what have I done?  Oh, my wife! my
wife! my beautiful murdered Laura!  Oh, what have I
done?  My love! speak&mdash;look up! live for me once more!
Oh, she is dead! and I am her murderer!"  And with a
shriek of agony, the wretched man fell prone on his face
beside her.
</p>

<p>
But now there came another sound more terrible than
all else.  Swollen by the heavy rain, the sea was rising on
the island.
</p>

<p>
With the roar of a beast of prey, the furious waves,
lashing themselves into foam, rushed upon the shore.  It
recalled the miserable assassin from his frenzy of despair;
and with the instinct of self-preservation that never
deserts us while life remains, he seized the cold, stark
form, and fled wildly up the beach.
</p>

<p>
But just then&mdash;had the infernal regions yielded up
their hosts to pursue him?&mdash;a human form, bearing tin
figure of a woman, revealed by the quick flashes of
lightning, came flying toward him, her uncovered hair
streaming in the gale&mdash;-her wild eyes glaring with the fires of
madness.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes fell upon him and his bleeding burden at the
same instant; and throwing up her arms, with a piercing
cry of "Murder! murder!" that pealed high above
the raging of the storm, she fled in the direction of
Campbell's Lodge.
</p>

<p>
That appalling cry, that awful apparition, drove the
last spark of reason from his maddening brain.  With a
perfect yell of terror, he flung his lifeless burden on the
rocks, and fled from the spot as if pursued by the avenger
of blood.

<p>
With blood on his hands, with horror, insanity,
and wildest woe in his eyes; and worse, far
worse! with the dreadful mark of Cain branded
indelibly on his brow, the wretched man fled&mdash;hating
himself, his crime, the earth, and heaven&mdash;only longing
to fly far away, where human eyes would never more behold
him, clutching his breast with his pale, talon-like fingers,
as if to tear hence his insufferable agony and remorse.
</p>

<p>
On he went&mdash;flying over rocks, and chasms, and
uprooted trees&mdash;on, on, still on, unable to stop.  The
waves were wildly, madly cannonading against the banks,
as if they would tear their way to where he stood, and
bodily ingulf him; but he heard nothing, save that
unearthly cry of "Murder!" saw nothing but the cold,
still face and lifeless form of his murdered wife.
</p>

<p>
Panting, tottering, exhausted, he fell heavily at last
on the ground&mdash;shuddering, gasping, collapsed.  The
deafening roar of the waves still rising and booming on
the beach, the crash of the thunder, the wild discord of
the raging elements were serenest music, compared with
the tumult, the terror of the unspeakable horror filling
his soul.
</p>

<p>
"What have I done?&mdash;what have I done!" was the cry
that still rived its way up through his tortured heart.
And the wind and waves, in their terrific uproar, seemed
answering the cry with "<i>Murder! murder!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Midnight approached, and the storm began to abate,
the rain ceased to fall, and the mighty waters began
sullenly retreating from the shore.
</p>

<p>
But still the stricken man lay prone on the ground,
dead to everything above, around, about him, with that
gnawing, unutterable remorse at his heart.
</p>

<p>
Another hour waned.  The clouds rolled away, the
lightning had ceased, the wind abated its fury, and the
troubled, heaving waves were slowly calming down.
And, suddenly, from behind a cloud, broke forth the
moon&mdash;brightly, gloriously, grandly shedding her soft,
silvery radiance over sea and land.
</p>

<p>
For the first time the murderer ventured to look up.
Morning was near at hand, and must not find him at the
scene of the tragedy.
</p>

<p>
"What is to be done next?" was the thought that arose
through all the distracting rush of grief, horror, and
remorse.  "She will be missed; and if I am found here I
will be taken for the murderer, and&mdash;"  A shuddering
spasm closed the sentence.
</p>

<p>
He rose to his feet, but tottered, so he could hardly
walk; and, as if hurried by some uncontrollable impulse,
took the road leading to the beach.
</p>

<p>
He reached the spot, where, in his first wild impulse of
terror, he had dropped the body; but, far beyond that,
the waves had risen, and the lifeless form was
gone&mdash;swept away by the boiling waters.
</p>

<p>
A groan, so deep and hollow, that it seemed like rending
his very heart, broke from his lips at the sight&mdash;his
murdered Laura had found a grave in the boundless sea.
</p>

<p>
A footstep behind met his ear, and in terror he turned
to fly; but, seeing only the half-witted boy, who had
brought him over, he restrained himself and stood still.
</p>

<p>
Even through the dull mist of his clouded brain, the
ghastly face before him, struck terror to the boy's soul.
And well it might; for, with that white, death-like face,
branded with a look of unutterable horror; those ashen
lips, sunken, collapsed cheeks, glazing eyes, shuddering
form, and trembling hands, he looked like a corpse
galvanized for a moment, into a hideous semblance of life.
</p>

<p>
The words he had been about to say, died on the boy's
lips; and, with distended mouth, and eyes all agape with
surprise and fear, he stared at him in stupid bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" came at length, from Courtney's lips, in a
voice so hollow, that it seemed to issue from an empty
coffin.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" said the boy, "frightened by
the storm?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" again came in deep, husky
tones from his livid lips.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you said you wanted to get back afore morning,
and I reckon we can start now.  The sea runs pretty
high, yet, but I guess there ain't no danger."
</p>

<p>
Like a man in a dream, Courtney passed his hand
across his brow, as though to clear away a cloud.  Again,
self-preservation, "the first law of nature," rose before
him overcoming every other feeling.  His eyes wandered
mechanically to the fatal spot, and he turned away with a
shudder.
</p>

<p>
"Can we reach N&mdash;&mdash; before morning breaks?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon so?" was the answer, "if we start now."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think there is any danger?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't think there is.   You'll be apt to be sea-sick,
though," said the boy; "waves run pooty high.  But
what makes you speak so hoarse, and look so scared, as
if you'd seed a ghost?  P'r'aps you did, too; they say
there's one up in that old house, there."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go!" said Courtney, unheeding his words, as
he folded his cloak closer around him, and started in the
direction of the boat.
</p>

<p>
The boy shuffled after him, to where the boat now lay,
high and dry on the strand, requiring the united efforts of
both, to launch her into the water.
</p>

<p>
"Precious hard time I had of it, all night in the
storm," said the lad, as he took the oars; "got soaked
right through; and, by golly! if there wasn't some
thunder!  I never wants to be out such a night again."
</p>

<p>
The boat was pitching and tossing wildly on the
heaving waves, threatening each moment to capsize; but
Courtney, lost to all sense of personal danger, sat
striving to dispel the cloud of horror and remorse from his
mind, and answer the momentous question: "What is to
be done next?"  His wife would assuredly be missed.
How was her sudden disappearance to be accounted for?
It seemed probable that none but Captain Campbell
knew of her intended visit to the isle, save the boy who
had brought her over; and, in waiting on the dark,
dangerous beach, in such a wild tempest, with the advancing
tide rising on the shore, what would be more natural
than that she had been accidentally overtaken, and swept
away by the rapid rising of the waves?
</p>

<p>
The mist was passing away from his mind, his burning
fever of excitement was abated by the cool sea-breeze,
and every faculty, preternaturaily sharpened by the fear
of being discovered as a murderer, was at work.  Of the
stupid lad who had brought him to the island he felt no
fear.  Before the coming day's sun had set he would in
all probability, have forgotten all about it, and none else
knew of the visit.  He would endeavor to hide all traces
of guilt, and be the most zealous in the search after the
lost one.  Perhaps, too, suspicion might fasten on
Captain Campbell, and <i>then</i> how amply would he be
revenged!  He thought of the note appointing the meeting,
and felt in his pocket for it, but it was gone.  No
matter&mdash;so that he himself was not criminated, it mattered
not.
</p>

<p>
Then came another thought: How was he to account
for his absence during the night?  It seemed scarcely
probable that his wife had told any of the inmates of the
parsonage of their angry parting and his brutal blow&mdash;she
had too much pride for that&mdash;and they could easily
be made to believe that sudden business had called him
away.  Doubtless, they would think it strange he had
not told them before going; but as he had already
acquired a character for eccentricity from his gloomy
reserve, it would be readily set down to that.  He had
business at Westport&mdash;he would go there&mdash;remain for
some hours, and return to N&mdash;&mdash; before night.
</p>

<p>
His plans thus rapidly arranged, he proceeded to
carry immediately into execution.  Lifting his head, he
said, briefly:
</p>

<p>
"I have changed my mind.  I will not go to N&mdash;&mdash;.
Take me to Westport."
</p>

<p>
Regarding him for a moment with his customary
vacant stare, the boy, without a word, turned the boat in
the direction indicated.
</p>

<p>
The rising sun was reddening the orient before they
reached Westport.  And Edgar Courtney having paid the
boy, dismissed him, and sauntered about the town until
the business of the day would begin.
</p>

<p>
Gradually the streets began to fill; men on their way
to their daily labor passed him in groups, now and then
stopping to gaze in wonder at the tall, muffled figure,
pacing through the streets as though he were hastening
for life or death.
</p>

<p>
He noticed this scrutiny at last, and slackened his
rapid strides, muttering inwardly:
</p>

<p>
"This will never do.  I must not allow my feelings to
carry me away thus.  I must be calm, or I may be
suspected.  Nothing but coolness will save me now."
</p>

<p>
Turning down the collar of his cloak, and pushing up
his hat, that the cool morning air might fan his feverish
brow, he turned in the direction of the Westport House.
</p>

<p>
The door had just been opened, and the rooms had
that dreary, uncomfortable look large, lonely rooms
always wear in the gray dawn of the morning, a yawning
waiter, half-asleep, passed him, staring with lack-luster
eyes, as though he had seen a ghost, and a slip-shod,
frizzle-headed chambermaid uttered a faint scream as her
eyes fell on his haggard face and wet garments.
</p>

<p>
"Let me have a private room immediately," was his
command to the waiter.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; this way, sir," said the man, recovering
from his surprise at the entrance of so strange-looking
an individual.
</p>

<p>
He ushered him into a neat, comfortably furnished
room, and Courtney threw himself into a chair, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Light a fire here, and bring me up a cigar and a cup
of strong coffee."
</p>

<p>
"A fire, sir," said the waiter, surprised at such a
demand in summer.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, a fire; did I not speak plainly enough,"
said Courtney, in a tone that sent the man hastily from
the room.
</p>

<p>
With his garments soaked through, he began to feel
cold and chilled; though in the fever of his mind, up to
the present, he had not observed it.  A fire was soon
kindled, and spreading his cloak and outer clothes before it
to dry, he threw himself on his bed to try and lose the
maddening recollection of the past night in sleep.
</p>

<p>
Totally exhausted by fatigue and excitement, he succeeded
at last, but only to re-act over again in his dreams
the catastrophe of the preceding hours.  Again he saw
the lifeless form of his murdered wife lying rigid at his
feet; then would flit before his horror-stricken gaze the
ghostly apparition of the isle, with its wild, terrific shriek
of "murderer!" then the gallows, the coffin, the hangman,
with all the fearful paraphernalia of the felon's
death, would rise in ghastly array before his distorted
imagination; he could feel the very rope encircling his
neck, and by some strange contradiction, his wife, bright,
beautiful, and happy as he had first known her, stood
smilingly adjusting it, and stranger still, he felt no
surprise at seeing her there; he heard the fatal signal given,
the drop sliding from beneath his feet, and with a shriek
of terror he sprang up out of bed, the cold perspiration
starting from every pore.
</p>

<p>
"Great Heaven! am I never to lose the recollection of
that fearful night, and my more awful crime?  Oh, for
the fabled waters of Lethe to drown recollection!  Must
I forever go through the world with this mark of Cain?&mdash;this
red-hot brand of murder on my face, as well as on
my soul?  Saints in heaven! should this dream prove
true?"
</p>

<p>
The guilty man paused, while his whole frame shook,
and his teeth chattered as though he had the ague.
</p>

<p>
"And yet it need not, unless this paltry cowardice of
mine betrays me," he again cried, starting wildly up and
pacing the room.  "How many murderers walk in the
open sunshine, in the broad face of day, through the very
heart of our most crowded cities, with impunity?  It
only requires nerve, courage, boldness, to face the worst,
and I can defy Satan himself and all his hosts.  Others
have committed murder before me, without any provocation
to excuse them, and it troubled them not.  Why,
then, should I, who only acted in vindication of my
wounded honor&mdash;and if ever murder is excusable, surely
it was in my case?  Why should I tremble, and shrink
from my very shadow?  Courage, coward soul?  These
dreams and phantoms of a disordered brain will pass
away, with time.  When this affair in some degree blows
over, I will hasten to London&mdash;to Paris; and in the
excitement and turmoil of a great city, forget the
miserable past.  Courage, Edgar Courtney!  Thou hast begun
a desperate game, and all thy boldness is required to
carry thee through!  Yes, I will put a bold face on it, and
dare the worst.  And, now Satan&mdash;for on thee alone dare
I call now&mdash;help me in this extremity, if ever thou didst
help me before!"
</p>

<p>
He paused before the glass, with clenched hands and
teeth, and almost started to see the wild, fierce look his
ghastly face wore.  His long elf-locks fell in wild
disorder over his face and neck, and added to the haggard
pallor of his countenance.
</p>

<p>
"This craven face will never do," he said; "I must
compose it.  And this disheveled hair must not hang
thus disordered.  She used to twine it round her fingers
once," he said, the look of agonizing sorrow and remorse
coming back: "but that time long ago passed away.  I
must not think of it more&mdash;let me only think of this man
for whose love she forgot she was already a wife."
</p>

<p>
The thought did bring a sort of fierce composure.
Brushing back the heavy black hair off his face and
brow, he threw on his now dry cloak, lighted one of the
cigars that lay on the table, and then rang a peal that
presently brought up one of the servants.  When the
man entered Courtney was lying back in the pillowy
depths of a lounging-chair, his feet extended to the fire,
looking, as he smoked&mdash;or, rather, trying to look&mdash;the
very picture of nonchalance.  It was a miserable failure
after all, as the wildly gleaming eyes still testified.
</p>

<p>
"Breakfast!" he said, briefly, to the bowing waiter.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  What will you please to have, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Anything&mdash;coffee&mdash;waffles.  I don't care what&mdash;only
be quick!"
</p>

<p>
The man disappeared, and presently returned with
fragrant coffee, delicious waffles, and eggs.
</p>

<p>
Courtney seated himself at the table, and drank cup
after cup of the strong coffee; but the first morsel he
attempted to swallow seemed to choke him.
</p>

<p>
The grateful beverage soothed his excited nerves
more speedily than all his reasoning and philosophy had
done.
</p>

<p>
Drawing out his watch and perceiving it was after ten,
he arose, put on his hat, and having settled his bill, was
about to leave the house, when he was suddenly
confronted by Captain Guy Campbell, who came running
up the outer steps, laughing at something that had
occurred outside.
</p>

<p>
For one moment the guilty soul of Courtney quailed
before the bold, bright glance of the young captain's
eye&mdash;for one moment only; the next, he looked up and met
his gaze with one of deep, sullen hate.
</p>

<p>
Touching his hat coldly, the young captain passed on,
and Courtney emerged into the street, all his fierce hatred
and jealousy returning with fourfold bitterness at the
thought of the contrast between them&mdash;he himself so
ghastly, so pallid, so haggard, and this lover of his dead
wife so handsome, dashing, and careless.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven's worst curses forever light upon him!" he
hissed, fiercely.  "That he&mdash;he who has caused me to do
what I have done&mdash;should be happy, flattered, and beloved,
while I&mdash;I whom he drove to madness, should be doomed
to a life of torture!  They tell us of a certain place&mdash;I
doubted its existence once, I do so no longer, for I
feel already some of its torments."
</p>

<p>
And any one seeing the demoniac look his face wore,
would not have doubted his words at that instant.
Entering a livery-stable, he hired a horse and gig, and
immediately started in the direction of N&mdash;&mdash;.
</p>

<p>
He dreaded the corning scene, and the false part he
would have to act in it; and yet, as if impelled by some
inward power, over which he had no control, he whipped
and lashed the horse in a sort of frenzy of impatience to
be there.  On he flew, his horse foaming and reeking in
sweat&mdash;houses, people, streets, passing with the velocity
of a dream, and yet all too slow for the burning, maniac
impatience that was consuming him.
</p>

<p>
He reached N&mdash;&mdash;, and consigning his panting horse
to the care of an innkeeper, within half a mile of the
parsonage, he set out for it at a rapid walk.  Ten minutes
brought him to it, and in spite of his haste, he paused, as
its sober, gray front and green window-shutters rose before
him, while a vague thrill of nameless terror shot through
him.
</p>

<p>
It was no time to hesitate now&mdash;the worst must be
faced at once.  Drawing his breath in hard, he approached
the door and rang.
</p>

<p>
The summons was answered by Jenny.  As he passed
into the hall, he encountered Mrs. Brantwell coming
down stairs.  That good lady's pleasant, cheery face wore
a look of unusual gravity as she greeted him, that for a
moment startled him out of his composure.
</p>

<p>
"Is my&mdash;I wish to see my wife, madam," he managed
to say, while every word seemed choking him.
</p>

<p>
"Your wife is in the parlor, Mr. Courtney," said
Mrs. Brantwell, gravely, as she held open the door for him to
enter&mdash;ascribing his evident agitation to a far different
cause.
</p>

<p>
For one moment his wild, maniac eyes were riveted
upon her with a look that actually terrified the good
minister's wife.  Reeling unsteadily, as though he had
suddenly received a violent blow, he passed her and entered
the parlor.
</p>

<p>
And there before him on the sofa, supported by pillows,
her little pale face looking out from its masses of
floating golden hair, with a look of beseeching entreaty
to be forgiven, lay she whom he supposed buried forever
under the wild waves.  For in instant he stood paralyzed,
speechless, with ashen face and dilating eyes.  And then
the last glimpse of hope and reason fled, and with a
terrific cry, that froze the life-blood of the hearers, the
wretched man fell senseless on the floor.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br><br>
MORNING IN THE ISLAND.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "And she was gone, and yet they breathed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not the breath of human life&mdash;<br>
  A serpent round each heart was wreathed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stung their every thought to strife."&mdash;BYRON.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And how dawned that morn on Campbell's Lodge?
How on the widow's cottage?
</p>

<p>
With that appalling shriek, that most terrible of
all cries, that unearthly scream of murder ringing in her
ears, Sibyl sprang from her sleepless couch, and while
her very heart thrilled with horror, waited for what was
to come next.
</p>

<p>
Through the lonely, silent old house, it echoed and
re-echoed like a knell of doom; but it was not repeated.
She could hear the wild wind rushing through the open
door, awakening strange, ghostly noises through the high,
empty rooms, but nothing else.
</p>

<p>
What had happened?  What was to be done?  Was it
only fancy?  Had she been dreaming, and was that cry
of murder only a delusion, after all?
</p>

<p>
No, it could not be; for, just as she was beginning to
think it was only the effect of fancy, she distinctly heard
footsteps flying up the stairs&mdash;a light, fleet step that
paused at her own door.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl's heart stood still.  It was but for an instant;
then the same piercing cry of "Murder!" rang through
the lonely house once more; the quick, light footsteps
flew down the long, winding staircase again, passed
through the echoing hall below, and then the large, heavy
front door was slammed to, with a violence that made the
old house shake, and all was again profoundly still.
</p>

<p>
In one instant, all the wild, ghostly legends she had
ever heard of the old mansion, rushed through Sibyl's
mind.  Heaven of heavens! could this be the spirit of
some murdered victim, returning from its bloody grave,
to seek for retribution on its murderer?  Sibyl Campbell,
naturally brave, was yet, as we know, superstitious,
and the terror that mortal man could never have inspired,
filled her very soul at the thought.  Shaking as with an
ague fit, for an instant she crouched upon the floor, her
face hidden in her hands, while memory recalled the tale
she had once heard, of a woman stabbed by one of her
dark, fierce forefathers, in that very house, whose restless
spirit (the legend ran) came when the storm was wildest,
and the furious tempest at its height, from her troubled
tomb amid the heaving waves, to denounce woe on her
murderer and on his descendants.
</p>

<p>
How long she sat she knew not, but the sound of the
old clock below, striking in deep, sonorous tones, that
echoed startlingly through the silent house,
one! two! three! recalled her once more to life.
</p>

<p>
That earthly sound brought her once more to herself.
She raised her head and looked wildly around.  Aunt
Moll lay near her, breathing heavily, and sleeping the
deep, dreamless, death-like sleep that seems peculiar to
the children of Africa.  The consciousness of
companionship&mdash;even though that companion was but a poor,
helpless old negress&mdash;brought renewed courage.  Rising, and
half ashamed of her superstitious fears, she walked to the
window and looked out.
</p>

<p>
The storm had passed away and the moon was shining
brightly, lighting up with her calm, pale radiance what
had so lately been a scene of deepest darkness and wildest
storm.  Her eyes wandered over the island; all there
was still and serene.  From thence they strayed out over
the boundless sea, and suddenly rested on an object that
banished all fears of supernatural visitors, and brought
with it a new alarm.
</p>

<p>
It was a boat&mdash;a boat that had evidently just put off
from the isle, and was rapidly disappearing in the
distance.
</p>

<p>
It held but two persons&mdash;she could see that.  But what
meant this midnight visit, in darkness and storm, to that
lonely isle?  What terrible deed, under cover of night
and tempest, had been perpetrated this night?
</p>

<p>
She caught her breath quick and short; but now that
she feared only earthly dangers and earthly foes, there
came with this discovery a deep breath of relief.  Some
one might still be concealed in the house&mdash;some one who
indulged in the popular belief that there was money
concealed in it somewhere.
</p>

<p>
There was no time to hesitate&mdash;the house must be
searched.  Lem must be aroused to assist in it.  He slept
in the opposite wing of the building, and, supposing any
one to be concealed in the empty rooms, the journey was
a hazardous one; but it could not be avoided.  Sibyl
grew quite calm in the face of this new danger, and,
stooping, she shook Aunt Moll by the shoulder to arouse
her.
</p>

<p>
A deep grunt, as the sleeper turned over and fell into
a deeper sleep than before, rewarded her exertions.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Moll, wake!  Wake, I say!  There are people
in the house," said Sibyl, in an anxious whisper, as she
shook her more violently than before.  "Oh, Heaven! what
shall I do?  Aunt Moll, wake! wake!  Do you want
to be murdered in your bed?" cried Sibyl, giving her a
shake that might have aroused the seven sleepers.
</p>

<p>
"Dar, Lem&mdash;dar!  Don't shake yer ole mammy, dat's
a good chile; 'tain't 'spectful, nor likewise&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here the sleeper sank into deep slumber, muttering
an incomprehensible something.
</p>

<p>
There was no time to lose&mdash;it was fruitless labor
seeking to wake Aunt Moll.  Seizing a lamp, she hastily
struck a light, and hastened out into the windy hall,
pausing for an instant at the head of the long, black
staircase, to listen, ere she ventured further.
</p>

<p>
The silence of the grave still reigned.  Nothing met
her ear but the faint echo of her own light footsteps.
</p>

<p>
Like a shadow she flitted down the dark, cheerless
staircase, through the lower hall into the kitchen, and
here she again paused to reflect.
</p>

<p>
The moonlight was pouring a light through the two
low-curtained windows and rendering the flickering
lamp superfluous.  Everything stood precisely as it had
the night before; chairs and table were in their places,
and had not been disturbed; a few red coals still glowed
like fierce eyes amid the darkness of the great, black,
yawning chimney&mdash;it was evident that no one had been
intruding here.
</p>

<p>
Pushing open a door leading directly from the kitchen
into Lem's sleeping-room, she entered it, and stood beside
him.  She could not spare time to try to arouse him by
ordinary means, so seizing a large pitcher of cold water
that stood near, she unceremoniously dashed it in his face,
drenching him completely.
</p>

<p>
The shock aroused him, as it well might; and, uttering
a fearful yell of mingled rage and terror, Lem sat
bolt upright in bed, unable to distinguish anything for
the light of the lamp that flashed directly in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" was his first ejaculation; "I's gwine for to be
'sassinated 'thout a minit's warnin'!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, hush, Lem! for Heaven's sake!  It's only I,
your mistress!" said Sibyl, putting one little white hand
over his huge black mouth.  "Get up and dress yourself
as quickly as possible, and join me in the kitchen, where
I will wait until you come."
</p>

<p>
And without waiting for the host of questions she saw
hovering on his lips, Sibyl passed out to the kitchen to
wait for him.
</p>

<p>
With teeth chattering, and shaking with terror, Lem
proceeded, with trembling fingers, to draw on his clothes.
Without waiting to make a very elaborate toilet, he
passed out to the kitchen, where Sibyl stood waiting in a
fever of impatience.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl!" he exclaimed, in trembling tones,
"What's happened?  Is we all gwine to be killed, or
anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  No, I hope not.  But&mdash;be silent now&mdash;I
greatly fear there are men concealed in the house somewhere.
Hush, I tell you!" she repeated, with a flash of
her bright eye that arrested the exclamation of terror on
Lem's lips.  "This is no time for idle exclamations.  I
only say I think there may be men here; if there are,
your noise will only reveal where we are; if there are
not, there is no occasion for your terror.  Come, follow
me; we must search the house."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Miss Sibyl, I's afeard!  'Deed, de Lord knows
I's afeard!" said poor Lem, in shivering tones.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!  Do you think you will be any safer here?
Come, give over your fears, and follow me," said Sibyl,
as she turned toward the hall once more.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Miss Sibyl, don't wenture!  We'll be all
'sassinated if you do."
</p>

<p>
And poor Lem wrung his hands in mortal terror,
while Sibyl hastened from room to room, but, as may be
anticipated, finding no one.
</p>

<p>
"What can this mean?" she thought.  "There was
certainly some one here to-night, and yet I find everything
undisturbed.  This is most strange; they must have
gone, too, for the house is perfectly still.  Oh, what
could that cry of murder have meant?  That voice and
that light, quick step belonged to a woman, most
certainly; yet what woman would venture out in such a
storm?  The girl Christie would not come, she is too
timid, neither was it her voice.  What&mdash;what can it all
mean?"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the recollection of the midnight visitor, the
fair, pale woman with the dark, wild hair and eyes, who
had bent over the couch of Willard Drummond the first
night he had spent in the lodge came over her.  It must
have been that same supernatural visitant; and Sibyl
grew for an instant faint and sick at the thought.
</p>

<p>
Further search in the house was fruitless; but her
impatience would not permit her to wait until morning
to investigate further.  Returning to the kitchen, where
Lem was on his knees, alternately groaning, praying, and
bemoaning his hard fate, she commanded him to get his
hat and come out with her, to see if any traces of
intruders could be found on the island.
</p>

<p>
In vain did Lem begin expostulating; Sibyl cut it
short by threatening him with her brother's future
vengeance if he did not instantly obey.  There was no help
for it; and trembling in every limb, the frightened darkey
followed his imperious mistress from the house.
</p>

<p>
All without was so calm and peaceful&mdash;all the more
calm and peaceful, contrasted with the wild uproar of the
storm a few hours before&mdash;that it seemed like sacrilege
even to think of deeds of violence in such a spot.  A
delicious odor from the distant pine forest filled the air,
and the fitful sighing of the wind among the trees, and
the dull booming of the waves on the shore, alone broke
the silence of early morning.  The moonlight, obscured
now and then by fitful clouds, brightly illumined their
way, but nothing betrayed the presence of others save
themselves on the isle that night.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl took the path leading in the direction from which
the boat had started, but there the waves were breaking with
the same monotonous sound, giving no indication of any
one having been there.  The tide had now receded
sufficiently to allow Sibyl to walk around the beach; and,
tempted by the calm beauty of the night, and feeling a
sense of security in the open air, she strolled on until she
reached the spot where Courtney, in his first moment of
alarm, had dropped the body of Christie.
</p>

<p>
Something caught her eye at some distance further
up, fluttering from a prickly thorn bush, evidently a
fragment of dress.  Feeling as if she had at last found some
clew, she approached the spot and found it to be a white
muslin handkerchief, but almost saturated with <i>blood</i>!
</p>

<p>
A sensation of horror came over Sibyl.  Had there
really been a murder committed there that night?  Shrinking
from touching it, she was about leaving the spot,
when near one corner, free from the horrible stains that
covered the rest, her eye fell on something like a name or
initials.  Taking the corner with the tips of her fingers,
she beheld, marked in full, the name "Christina."
</p>

<p>
It was hers, then, Christie's.  What could have
brought it there?  Had anything happened to her?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, impossible!" thought Sibyl.  "Who is there in
the world to whom she is of the slightest importance,
living or dead, except indeed, to me?  Willard has gone;
she is, in all probability, safely asleep in yonder cottage;
and I am only torturing myself by useless fears.  I will
return to the lodge, and leave to-morrow to unravel this
mystery."
</p>

<p>
So saying, to the great satisfaction of her attendant,
who had all this time been cautiously walking behind
her, looking fearfully at every tree and rock, and fancying
an assassin in their very shadows, Sibyl turned slowly
toward the old hall.  On their way they passed the
cottage of Mrs. Tom.  All was perfectly quiet there; and,
mystified and uneasy still, Sibyl sought her room once
more, to wonder and speculate upon the events of the
night until morning should dawn.
</p>

<p>
The bustling little widow, Mrs. Tom&mdash;like all those
who seem to have least occasion for it&mdash;was in the habit
of getting up very early in the morning, to the serious
annoyance of young Mr. Henley, who preferred letting
the sun rise without impertinently staring at him while
doing so.  Christie, too, would just as soon not be
awakened from some rosy dream at daylight, by the shrill
voice of the old lady; but Aunt Tom's word was law,
and when she called there was no such word as disobey.
The little widow was quite aware of their disinclination
for early rising, therefore great was her amazement, upon
going to the outer room, to find Christie absent, the bed
made, the door unlocked, giving evidence of her being up
and out.
</p>

<p>
"Well!" ejaculated Mrs. Tom, "what won't come to
pass!  Next thing, I s'pose, will be Carl offering to wash
the dishes without bein' told.  Shouldn't wonder if he
was up and off this mornin', too.  Fust time I ever knew
Christie to git up 'thout bein' told.  Here, you Carl!
Carl!" shrieked Mrs. Tom, going to the foot of the ladder
and looking up through the trap.
</p>

<p>
A sound she was well accustomed to, something
between a snort and a groan, was Mr. Henley's answer.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry up there, ef ye don't want me to go up and
help ye," called Mrs. Tom, "ef I do, ye'll wish ye had
got up 'thout my help, that's all.  I'll dress you, I
reckon."
</p>

<p>
Now, as this was a formula Mrs. Tom had repeated
every morning for some ten years, without ever being
known to vary it in the least, Carl was too well accustomed
to it to venture to disobey.  Accordingly, he sprang
up, and began dressing in all haste, considering he was
half asleep during the performance.  Mrs. Tom meanwhile
set about kindling a fire, and preparing the breakfast,
a meal which was usually over before the sun was
up, and dressed for the day.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Christie?" was Carl's first question, upon
reaching the kitchen, as he glanced in the direction of the
settle, where, every morning, about this hour, he was
accustomed to see her making her bed.
</p>

<p>
"Up and gathering sea-moss an hour ago, I'll be
bound," replied Mrs. Tom, "same as you would do, ef
you wasn't the most shiftless young vagabones on the
face of the airth!  I hope now this will be a warning to
you for the future.  Think o' all the sea-moss, and
berries, and sich, you could have gathered every mornin'
'fore this time, ef you was worth your salt.  But it al'ays
was my luck, ever since I was born, to be plagued with a
set o' the laziest, most good-for-nothing bein's ever I saw
upon the face of the airth!  Stand out o' my way, will
you, ef you don't want to break my neck!"
</p>

<p>
Trot, the unfortunate cat, came in as usual, for the
latter part of this outburst of eloquence, emphasized by
a vigorous kick.
</p>

<p>
"Lor' sakes, Aunt Tom," exclaimed Master Carl,
roused to something like indignation by this unexpected
harangue.  "You don't want a feller to get up in the
middle of the night, do you?  By granny, it's too bad!
No matter how early a feller gets up, you always think
he ought to get up earlier still.  'Spose you'll be waking
me 'bout midnight pretty soon, ugh?"
</p>

<p>
Most of this reply was delivered <i>pianissimo</i> (that
being the most prudent tone), and accordingly did not
reach Mrs. Tom's ears, who was blustering out and in,
sharp and breezy as the goddess of morning, bringing in
wood and water, and beginning to knead biscuit.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, grumble," said the active little woman.  "I
never knew you doing anything else ef you was told to
work.  Pity if a great, big, lazy fellow like you can't get
up as airly as Christie, a delicky young gal, too!  See
her, up and out while you was snorin' away like a pig
up there!  you ought to be 'shamed o' yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I say, Aunt Tom," said Carl, looking up with as
much interest as his usually expressionless face could
assume, "was she out a little 'fore twelve, when it was
a-stormin' so?"
</p>

<p>
"'Fore twelve?" said Mrs. Tom, in a high key, as she
imagined her dutiful nephew was making fun of her.
"Look here now, you Carl, ef I hadn't my hands in this
dough, I'd box your ears till you wouldn't ask me such a
question agin."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Aunt Tom," said Carl, in a whimpering tone,
"it's too bad, so it is; a feller carn't say nothing you
don't get mad at.  If it wan't Christie, 'twas Miss Sibyl!
I saw some woman or other out, 'bout midnight, running
like mad through the storm&mdash;an' what's more, I heard
her, too."
</p>

<p>
"My conscience!" ejaculated Mrs. Tom, lifting up
her floury hands in holy terror, "my conscience! how
that there boy does lie!  Carl Henley, do you mean to
tell me that you was out in that storm last night, and saw
Miss Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I wa'n't out myself," said Mr. Henley, tearing
the comb fiercely through his tow-locks, in his deep
indignation at having his veracity and reason both doubted.
"But I seen what I saw, for all that.  S'pose you ha'n't
forgotten, Aunt Tom, that there's a pane of glass broken
out of one of the windows up stairs, with your old
bonnet stuck through it.  Well," said Carl, in a slightly
subdued tone, "your old bonnet got blown out with the
wind last night, and the fust thing woke me was the rain
a-beating into my face.  So I jumped up to fix it, and,
jest as I got to the window, there came such a flash of
lightning as I never seen afore.  Blamed if I didn't think
I was a goner!  Everything for nigh onto ten minutes
was considerably clearer nor day; and just then I saw a
woman flying through the storm, like as if all creation
was after her, and as she passed the house, I heard her
singing out <i>mother</i>, or <i>murder</i>&mdash;I don't know which.
I was pretty considerable scared, though I did think
it was only Miss Sibyl, for she had long black hair
a-flyin' behind her, jist like hers.  When the flash went
away I couldn't see nothing, for it was as dark as all
outdoors; and though I was scared of the storm, I wanted
to see if it was Miss Sibyl, and I stood there, waiting for
the next; but when it came, she was gone."
</p>

<p>
"My sakes!" exclaimed Mrs. Tom, whose deepest
interest was for the moment arrested.  "What did you do
then?"
</p>

<p>
"Well then," said Carl, in a lower key, as though
sorry his story had not a more thrilling sequel, "I got
tired a-settin' up, so I laid down and went to sleep.  Who
do you s'pose it was, Aunt Tom?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it was anybody.  S'pose folks is fools
to run out in sich a storm as that there?  I know Miss
Sibyl had queer notions sometimes, but she has more
sense, I reckon, nor to go out philandering through the
rain."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it must have been somebody," said Carl, with
a sort of dogged resolution.  "I know I seen a woman
running like a house a-fire through all the wind and
rain."
</p>

<p>
"No, you didn't," said Aunt Tom, shortly.  "'Twas
only a touch of nightmare; so don't bother me any more
about it."
</p>

<p>
Thus ignominiously silenced, Carl proceeded lazily to
assist in the preparation for breakfast, which he would
greatly have preferred discussing, if left to himself, to
getting ready.
</p>

<p>
The coffee and biscuits were smoking at length, on the
table, but Christie did not make her appearance.
</p>

<p>
"Very strange," said Mrs. Tom; "don't see what in
the world keeps the gal.  Here it is going on to seven
o'clock, and my work a-standing, while we're waiting for
her.  Carl, jest run out and see ef you can see her."
</p>

<p>
Carl started on his mission, but soon returned,
announcing that nothing was to be seen of her.
</p>

<p>
"Then there's no use a-waiting any longer," said
Mrs. Tom.  "Set down; may be she's gone to the lodge to
breakfast with Miss Sibyl."
</p>

<p>
The meal was over, the service cleared away.  Carl set
out to weed the garden; Mrs. Tom sat down to her
wheel.  But still Christie came not.
</p>

<p>
"Very strange!" observed Mrs. Tom, at last beginning
to grow uneasy.  "Ten o'clock, and Christie not here
yet!  My stars!  I wonder ef anything can hev happened
to her?  I've noticed she's been kind o' silent and pinin'
away for the last two or three days.  I hope nothin's
happened to her.  Oh, here she is now!  No 'tain't neither;
it's Miss Sibyl."
</p>

<p>
The little widow rose, and came smiling and cheery to
the door to welcome her guest.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Miss Sibyl, I'm glad to see you.  Walk in and
sit down.  I thought when you and Master Guy came
home from furrin parts you'd stay comfortably on the
island; but, 'stead o' that, we never see you no more nor
if you was in Canada or Rooshia, or any other outlandish
place.  How's the captain, and that Mr. Drummond?"
</p>

<p>
"They were both very well when I saw them last,"
said Sibyl, smiling slightly, as she took the proffered seat,
from which Mrs. Tom had been whisking some invisible
particles of dust with her apron.  "I hope you have been
quite well yourself, Mrs. Tom?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, tol'bul," said Mrs. Tom, complacently.  "Fact
is, you know, I hain't no time to be sick; it's only rich
folks, what's well off, can afford to indulge in sickness.
So you've had a great fortune left you, Miss Sibyl, I've
hearn tell!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Guy and I have received a legacy."
</p>

<p>
"Well, the Lord never does forget his critters; and
every now and then something's allers sure to happen.
I've allers remarked that myself.  I s'pose you don't
intend to stay here much longer, Miss Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
"I rather think not.  We will leave you to keep the
island, Mrs. Tom.  But where is your niece this morning?
I do not see her!"
</p>

<p>
"She went out this morning before any of us got up,
and hasn't come back yet.  I'm getting rale onasy," said
Mrs. Tom, anxiously, getting up and going to the door.
"I thought she had gone to see you."
</p>

<p>
Sibyl gave a sudden start, and grew deathly pale as
she thought of the handkerchief, the wild cry of murder,
and the men leaving the island during the night.  A
terrible presentiment flashed across her mind, and, sick and
dizzy, she fell back in her chair and pressed her hand over
her heart.
</p>

<p>
"My gracious!  Miss Sibyl, what's the matter?  Are
you sick?" said Mrs. Tom, turning suddenly, and seeing
with alarm the unaccountable paleness of the young lady.
"Here's some camphire; smell of it, or ye'll faint."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I do not require it," said Sibyl, rising
with an effort, and striving to be calm.  "Have you any
idea what time Christie left the house?"
</p>

<p>
"Not the slightest idee; 'cause I was asleep at the
time.  Carl says&mdash;though there's no puttin' confidence in
him&mdash;that, somewheres 'bout midnight, he seed a woman
runnin' through the storm, and singin' out 'murder!'  But
in course he was dreaming; there couldn't hev bin
any sich thing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, merciful Heaven! then it was no delusion on my
part, since I heard it, too.  Oh, this is dreadful!" said
Sibyl, wringing her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl, what's happened?" said Mrs. Tom, growing
very pale.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mrs. Tom!  Heaven help you, Christie!"
</p>

<p>
"Christie! what of her?" cried Mrs. Tom, grasping a
chair to steady herself.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mrs. Tom! must I tell you?  Christie, I fear,
went out last night in the storm, and&mdash;oh, Heaven!"
said Sibyl, sinking into a chair, with a convulsive
shudder.
</p>

<p>
"And what, Miss Sibyl?  Tell me, quick!  Was she
swept away in the storm?" said Mrs. Tom, striving to
strangle her trembling tones.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, worse&mdash;worse!  I fear; still worse!" said Sibyl,
wildly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my soul! what has happened?  Oh, Christie! dear
Christie! where are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Christie has, I fear, been waylaid and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Murdered!  Oh, Heaven!" exclaimed Mrs. Tom,
falling back in her chair and covering her face with her
hands.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's awful silence.  Then Mrs. Tom,
who (no matter what the emergency) never allowed
her ever-practical mind to be long overclouded, dropped
her hands from before her face, and, though she was
frightfully pale, said, in a voice whose firmness astonished
Sibyl:
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think so, Sibyl?  My poor little
Christie had not an enemy in the world!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! she had&mdash;she had!" cried Sibyl, thinking, with
bitter remorse, how intensely she herself had hated her.
</p>

<p>
"Who was it?" said Mrs. Tom, starting up.  "No one
but a monster could have hurted one hair of her gentle
head!  Miss Sibyl, who do you think has done it?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know&mdash;as Heaven hears me, I do not know!"
said Sibyl, recovering herself.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think she was murdered?" said
Mrs. Tom, who by this time had recovered all her
customary composure, and now fixed her eyes keenly on
Sibyl's face.
</p>

<p>
"Last night I, too, like your nephew, heard the cry of
murder," said Sibyl, shuddering at the recollection; "and
early this morning, I discovered in a bush, down near the
shore, a pocket-handkerchief, stained with blood, and
marked with her name!"
</p>

<p>
"Where is the handkerchief?"
</p>

<p>
"It is there still; I did not touch it."
</p>

<p>
"Come, then, and show me the place," said Mrs. Tom,
a sudden passionate outburst of sorrow breaking through
all the composure she was endeavoring to assume.
</p>

<p>
Without exchanging a word, they hurried to the
spot, where the ghastly handkerchief still fluttered in the
breeze.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is hers!" exclaimed Mrs. Tom.  "They have
murdered her on the beach, and the tide has swept her
away.  Oh, Christie!  Christie!"
</p>

<p>
And bowing her face in her hands, for the first time
she wept passionately.
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause, broken only by Mrs. Tom's
convulsive sobs.  Sibyl stood wrestling with her own
bitter thoughts, not daring to break in upon her grief by
any useless words of comfort.
</p>

<p>
At last Mrs. Tom looked up, her tears seemingly
changed to sparks of fire.
</p>

<p>
"Who has done this?  <i>You</i> know!" she said, gloomily,
laying her hand on Sibyl's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven be merciful!  I do not."
</p>

<p>
"Have you no idea?  Is there no clew?  Speak; for
if there is law or justice in the land, those who have done
this deed shall suffer."
</p>

<p>
"The only clew is one so slight that even now I do
not know whether I really saw it or dreamed that I did,"
said Sibyl, hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, and tell me what it is.  I must know," said
Mrs. Tom, with a sort of grim vengeance.
</p>

<p>
"Then listen.  Last night after the moon rose&mdash;some
two hours, I should judge, after I heard that cry of
murder&mdash;on going to the window to look out, I perceived a
boat push off from the shore containing the forms of two
men; but so speedily did they vanish from sight, that I
had barely time to catch the dark outlines of their figures.
As it all passed so quickly, I ani still half disposed to
believe it the effect of fancy."
</p>

<p>
"No boat could reach the island in the storm last
night," said Mrs. Tom, still keeping her gloomy eyes
fixed on Sibyl's face.
</p>

<p>
"I know that; and that is the principal reason I have
for thinking what I saw may be the effect of fancy.  And
yet&mdash;and yet some one must have been here, else how are
we to account for the committing of the deed?  And
what could have induced Christie to go out in such a
storm, and at such an hour?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know; it is all wrapped in mystery," said
Mrs. Tom, taking the handkerchief and turning away.
"But I'll find it out&mdash;I'll discover the murderers, if I
should spend my whole life in seeking for them myself.'
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean to do?" said Sibyl, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"To have the island searched the first thing.  I
suppose you will let Lem come and help?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  But would it not be a better plan to go
over to N&mdash;&mdash; immediately, and inform the authorities,
and let them investigate the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Carl shall take me right over," said Mrs. Tom.
</p>

<p>
"I will accompany you," said Sibyl; "we may both
be needed to give testimony."
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, the boat, containing Carl, Mrs. Tom,
and Sibyl, was dancing over the water in the direction
of N&mdash;&mdash;, to electrify the community by the announcement
of the atrocious deed.
</p>

<p>
But where, meantime was Christie?  Had she really,
as they so readily supposed, found a grave beneath the
wild waves?
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br><br>
CHRISTIE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Then she took up her burden of life again,<br>
  Saying only, 'It might have been.'<br>
  God pity them both! and pity us all<br>
  Who vainly the dreams of youth recall,<br>
  For of all sad words of tongue or pen,<br>
  The saddest are these, 'It might have been.'"&mdash;WHITTIER.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
With the cold rain falling in her face, the colder
wind fanning her brow, Christie awoke from that
deep swoon that had been mistaken for death.
</p>

<p>
She opened her eyes, and gazed vacantly around, but
all was dark as Erebus.  There was a roaring sound, as
of many waters, in her ears&mdash;a vague, dull sense of some
awful calamity, a heavy, suffocating feeling in her chest,
a misty consciousness of some one supporting her head.
Dark and dreary was the night around, but darker and
drearier lay the heart in her bosom.  Memory made a
faint effort to regain its power, to recall some dreadful
woe that pressed like leaden weights on her bosom, but
in vain.  Only that dull aching at her heart, only some
past unutterable sorrow&mdash;that was all.
</p>

<p>
Bodily as well as mentally every faculty was prostrated.
She made an effort to speak, to ask what had
happened, to know where she was; but her lips moved in
vain, no word came forth.  She strove to rise, but at the
first faint motion a sudden pang, like a dagger-thrust,
pierced her breast, and she fell back in a deadly swoon
once more.
</p>

<p>
When next she woke to consciousness she found herself
lying in a bed, with the bright sunshine shining in
broad patches on the floor.  Memory had not yet resumed
its throne, and of that last dreadful night she was
mercifully prevented from recalling anything.  She strove in
vain to collect her thoughts; nothing could be remembered,
only that strange aching&mdash;that vague, unspeakable
pang that lay on her heart still.
</p>

<p>
She cast her eyes, in a sort of languid amaze, about
the room where she lay, with a dreamy wonder how she
had got there.  She saw indistinctly, as we see things in
a dream, a small, square room, with a rough, uncarpeted
floor; two chairs, a small table, and various articles of
wearing-apparel hanging around the walls.  A little
stand, on which lay bottles, linen bandages, and a glass
filled with a dark liquid stood near the head of the bed
on which she lay.  At the foot of the bed was a small,
square window, covered with a dark paper blind, but
through which the sunlight peeped here and there in
chinks.
</p>

<p>
All was profoundly still.  She could hear the flies
buzzing and droning as they flew over her head; she
could hear what she fancied must be trees waving gently
in the wind, with a low, soothing sound, inexpressibly
sweet; and like a wearied child she closed her eyes, and
fell into a deep slumber.
</p>

<p>
Again she awoke; and now she knew it must be
night.  Some one had evidently been in the room while
she slept, for the curtain had been rolled up from the
window, and the moonlight came softly and brightly in.
She could see, without moving, the tall, dark trees
beyond; and she knew she must be in the forest.  Once
more her eyes wandered round the room; and reason
now made a terrible effort to resume its powers.  Where
was she?  What had happened?  Who had brought her
here?  As her mind began to clear, and consciousness to
return, question after question rose to her lips.  She
closed her eyes, and struggled to recall the past.
Gradually the broken links in the chain of memory began to
reunite.  She recalled the note Willard had sent her, that
appointed their meeting on the beach&mdash;that night of
storm and tempest through which she had gone to meet
him&mdash;that meeting&mdash;and then, with a pang sharper than
death, came the terrible recollection of his plunging the
knife into her side.
</p>

<p>
She could think no further, the recollection of that
dreadful moment seemed driving her mad.  She made an
effort to rise, to cry out; but just then, a hand was laid
soothingly on her forehead, and a voice met her ear,
saying:
</p>

<p>
"Gently, gently, my child.  Thee must not get up.
Here, lie still, and drink this."
</p>

<p>
Some one&mdash;she could not tell whether it was man or
woman&mdash;was bending over her, and holding the glass to
her lips.  Too weak to resist, she drank it off, and almost
instantaneously, fell into a deep sleep.
</p>

<p>
Days, weeks passed before consciousness returned.
During all that time she had a vague idea of talking,
raving wildly, incoherently to Willard&mdash;imploring him
not to kill her, and she would never reveal their
marriage; and then shrieking aloud as though again she felt
the steel entering her bosom.  Sometimes, too, she fancied
Sibyl standing before her, with her wild, black, menacing
eyes, as she had been the last time she saw her, and
once again, would she clasp her little, pale hands, and
piteously implore her to spare her.  Anon her mood
would change, and she would speak in low, subdued
tones of Mrs. Tom and Carl, and strive to rise from bed,
saying wildly, "she must go home to Aunt Tom."  And
then, falling back exhausted, she would vaguely see a
kind face bending over her, a hand holding a cooling
drink to her lips, or wetting and arranging the bandages
on her wound.  This, too, like the rest, would pass, and
life and thought would again fora time be blotted out.
</p>

<p>
But one bright, golden, August afternoon, the blue
eyes opened, no longer wild with the fires of fever, but
calm and serene once more.  A naturally strong
constitution, united with youth, and skillful though rough
nursing, had triumphed at last over her long and
dangerous illness.
</p>

<p>
Weak as an infant; unable to move hand or foot;
pale, thin, and spiritual as a shadow, she came back to
life once more.  Her feet had stood on the threshold of
the valley of the shadow of death, but they were not
permitted to pass therein; and the soft eyes looked forth
from the little wan face, with the light of reason again.
</p>

<p>
It was a glorious summer evening.  From the window
at her feet, she could see the tall trees crowned with
sunshine, that fell like a glory on her pale, transparent brow.
Through the open door, came floating in the delicious
odor of flowers, and the sweet, wild songs of birds,
breathing of peace and holy calm.
</p>

<p>
While she yet lay with her little, wan hands lying
listlessly on the quilt, the gentle quiet of the sylvan
scene stealing into her heart, too weak even to think, she
heard a footstep beside her, a hand lightly arranging her
pillows, and then a voice, one of the kindest Christie had
ever heard, saying;
</p>

<p>
"How does thee feel to-day, my child?"
</p>

<p>
Christie lifted her eyes languidly, and saw a man
bending over her.  He might have been forty years of
age; short, square, and ungainly in form, but with a
chest and shoulders betokening vast, almost herculean
strength.  His hair was almost white, but dark streaks
here and there showed what had been its original color;
his face, with its irregular features, would have been
positively ugly, had it not been for the expression of
benevolence, of quiet goodness&mdash;the gentle, tender look it wore,
that seemed shedding a very halo around it, and you forgot
the brown skin, the rough, large features, the bushy
eyebrows, and stony gray eyes in the almost womanly
sweetness and softness of his smile.  His dress was a
long, drab coat, with blue homespun vest and trousers.
</p>

<p>
At any other time this unexpected apparition might
have alarmed Christie, but that gentle voice reassured
her; and she answered, faintly:
</p>

<p>
"Better, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"That is well.  Thee feels weak, does thee not?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes&mdash;so weak," she said, closing her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I expected as much.  Thee has been very, very
ill," said the man, adjusting a pillow, and shading the
light, with the skillful hand of a practiced nurse.
</p>

<p>
A thousand questions were rising to Christie's lips,
but she was too utterly prostrated to give them voice.
She fixed her eyes wistfully on the man's face with a
questioning gaze that brought him once more to her side.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my daughter, what does thee now want?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me"&mdash;the faint whisper died away, and totally
exhausted, the hand she had half raised fell again by her
side.
</p>

<p>
"Does thee want to know how thou camest here?"
</p>

<p>
A faint motion of her head, and that eager, inquiring
gaze, was the sole reply she could make.
</p>

<p>
"It may excite thee too much; thee had better wait
until thee is stronger, child," said the man, gently.
</p>

<p>
"Now&mdash;now!" she faintly gasped, with that wild,
troubled, imploring look still riveted on her face.
</p>

<p>
"Then, I found thee on the beach one wild, stormy
night, three weeks ago, wounded nigh unto death."
</p>

<p>
A spasmodic shudder convulsed all her frame.  Oh! what
would she not have given for strength to ask for
Willard!  Where was he?  Would he be arrested for
what he had done?  She longed to know that he was
safe and well; all she had suffered herself was as nothing
compared to that.  She wanted to ask how this man had
come there&mdash;where she was now&mdash;if Mrs. Tom knew of
this; but, to save her soul from death, she could not utter
a word.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the man read her thoughts in that eager,
almost passionate gaze, for he said:
</p>

<p>
"Thee wants to ask how I came on the island that
night, does thee not?"
</p>

<p>
She made a faint motion in the affirmative.
</p>

<p>
"That would be too long a story for thee to hear now,
my child.  When thou art stronger I will tell thee all.
Rest content with knowing that thou art safe, and with
friends who will care for thee as though thou wert their
own.  Thou must drink this now."
</p>

<p>
One question more&mdash;one on which more than life or
strength depended.  Willard!  Willard! she <i>must</i> ask of
him.
</p>

<p>
Pushing back the proffered drink, which she knew
contained some narcotic for sending her asleep, she
collected all her energies for the effort and managed faintly
to say:
</p>

<p>
"Was there&mdash;did you see the one who&mdash;who wounded me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my daughter; the assassin had fled, most probably.
I saw no one but thee, and made no further search.
Now thee must not talk just yet.  In two or three days
thee will be stronger, and then I will tell thee everything
thee wishes to know."
</p>

<p>
Too weak to resist, and deeply relieved that he had
not seen Willard, she quaffed the proffered draught, that
brought with it balmy sleep.
</p>

<p>
During the next two or three days the man was her
most zealous nurse, tending her with a zeal, care, and
gentle solicitude few nurses could have equaled, but
resisting all her efforts to draw him into conversation.
</p>

<p>
"By and by, daughter.  Be patient, and thee will
learn all," was ever his firm reply, given, however, in the
very gentlest of tones.
</p>

<p>
Left thus to herself and her own thoughts, as she grew
stronger, Christie's mind strove to comprehend and
account for the motive that had prompted Willard to
commit so dreadful a deed.  That it was he she never for
a moment thought of doubting.  That the act had been
premeditated, the note he sent her appointing the meeting,
on that lonely spot, at the dead hour of the night,
fully proved.  But his motive?  That, too, she had
settled in her own mind.  She had heard that he loved
Sibyl Campbell before he met her.  Now, Sibyl was an
heiress, courted and admired by all for her beauty and
wealth; what so natural, then, as that he should wish to
make this peerless Queen of the Isle his bride?  She was
the only obstacle that stood in his way; therefore, he
had, no doubt, resolved to murder her, to make way for
Sibyl.  Perhaps, too, he had heard her message to Sibyl,
and, guessing its purport, resolved that the secret of this
marriage should never go forth.
</p>

<p>
Long before, she had felt he was tired of her; but she
had never before dreamed he wished for her death.  Yes,
she felt as firmly convinced that it was his hand that
struck the blow&mdash;she felt as firmly convinced, too, that
these were his motives, as she did of her very existence;
and yet, in the face of all this, she loved him still.  Yes,
loved him so well, forgave him so freely, that she
resolved he should never know of her existence; she
would no longer stand between him and happiness.  She
would never return to the world she had so nearly
quitted; she would fly far away where no one would ever
know or hear of her; or she would stay buried here in
the depths of the forest with this recluse, whoever he was,
if he would permit her.
</p>

<p>
She thought of Mrs. Tom and Carl; they were the
only ones in the wide world who cared for her.  How
would they account for her absence?&mdash;what construction
would they put on her sudden flight?  She could not
tell: but she felt, long before this, that they had given
her up for lost, and this grief for her loss would soon
abate.  Yes, her resolution was taken&mdash;she would never
go back to the island more.
</p>

<p>
With this determination taken, her mind grew calm;
for hers was not a nature for long or passionate grief.
It is true, she wept convulsively at times; but this mood
would soon pass away, and she would lie quietly, calmly
for hours after, watching the trees sleeping in the
sunshine, willing to submit quietly to whatever the future
might have in store for her&mdash;like a stray leaf whirling down
the stream of life, willing to set whichever way the
current willed.
</p>

<p>
Her strange, rough-looking, but really gentle nurse
was still indefatigable in his cares for her; but, as yet,
he had told her nothing of himself, nor his object in
visiting the island that night.  Christie used to look up in
his hardy, honest face sometimes, and wonder vaguely, as
she did everything else, what possible reason could have
brought him there.
</p>

<p>
One other circumstance perplexed her not a little.
Once or twice she had caught sight of a female form and
face moving about in the outer room.  It had been only
a momentary glimpse, and yet it vividly recalled the
wild, weird woman she had seen in the island on her
bridal night.  There was the same pale, strange face; the
same wild, streaming black hair; the same dark, woeful
eyes; and Christie trembled in superstitious terror as she
thought of her.  Many times, too, she heard a light, quick
footstep moving about, which she knew could not belong
to her host; the soft rustling of female garments; and at
times, but very rarely, a low, musical voice, talking softly,
as if to herself.
</p>

<p>
All this perplexed and troubled Christie; and she
would have asked the man about her, only&mdash;as he never
by any chance mentioned her himself&mdash;she feared offending
him by what might seem impertinent curiosity.
</p>

<p>
In a few days Christie was well enough to sit up at
the window of her room, and drink in the health-giving,
exhilarating air, and listen to the songs of the birds in
the trees around.  She saw this hut&mdash;for it was little
more&mdash;was situated in the very depths of the great forest,
far removed from every other habitation.  As yet, she
had not stepped beyond the precincts of her narrow
chamber; but, one morning, tempted out by the genial
warmth and invigorating beauty of the day, she had
arisen for the purpose of going out for a short walk.
</p>

<p>
As she entered the outer room, she glanced around
with some curiosity.  It was a small, square apartment,
scarcely larger than the one she had quitted, containing
little furniture, and that of the rudest kind.  Two small,
uncurtained windows admitted the bright sunshine, and
opposite the door was a low, smoky-looking fire place.
A bed occupied one corner, and a primitive-looking deal
table the other.
</p>

<p>
No one was in the room; but the door was wide open,
and in the porch beyond Christie caught sight of a female
sitting on the ground, with her back toward her.  There
was no mistaking those long, black, flowing tresses, and
for a moment she hesitated and drew back in terror.  But
her attitude and manner showed her to be no phantom of
an excited imagination, but a woman like herself; and
curiosity proving stronger than dread, Christie softly
approached her, but with a fluttering heart.
</p>

<p>
Whether the woman heard her or not, she did not
move, and Christie was permitted to approach and look
over her shoulder unnoticed.  A little gray and white
kitten was in her lap, which went spinning round and
round after a straw which the woman held above its head,
now and then breaking into a peal of silvery laughter at
its futile attempts to catch it.
</p>

<p>
Surprise at this unexpected occupation held Christie
for a time spell-bound; but reassured now that the person
she beheld was flesh and blood like herself, she passed
her and went out.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the strange woman looked up from her
occupation and glanced at Christie; and then, without
further notice, resumed her play with the kitten, just as
if she had not seen her at all.  But in that one brief,
fleeting glance, Christie read her sad story.  The woman
before her was <i>insane</i>.
</p>

<p>
In mingled sorrow, surprise, and curiosity, Christie
stood gazing upon her.  She could do so with perfect
impunity, for the woman never raised her eyes to look at
her after that one careless, passing glance, every faculty
being apparently absorbed by her straw and her kitten.
In years, she might have been five-and-thirty, with a face
which, it spite of its total want of expression, was still
singularly beautiful.  Her tall, slender form was
exquisitely rounded, and her long, rich, waving hair floated
like black raveled silk over her fair, sloping shoulders.
Every feature was beautifully chiseled; her complexion
dazzlingly fair, almost transparent; and her large, black,
brilliant eyes magnificent, despite their vacant, idiotic
stare.  Her hands and feet were of most aristocratic
smallness and whiteness; for she wore neither shoes nor
stockings.  Her dress was of coarse brown serge, but it
could not mar the beautiful form it covered.
</p>

<p>
Moments passed unheeded, while Christie stood gazing
sadly on the lovely wreck of womanhood before her,
and wondering what could have driven her insane, and
why she and this man dwelt alone here, so far removed
from human habitation.  She wondered what relation
they bore to each other.  He could not be her father&mdash;he
was not old enough for that; neither could he be her
brother&mdash;they were too totally dissimilar in looks.
Perhaps he was her husband; but even that did not seem
probable.
</p>

<p>
While she thus idly speculated, the woman suddenly
arose, and clasping her kitten in her arms, turned and
walked rapidly away in the direction of the woods, without
once glancing at Christie, and was soon lost to sight
amid the trees.
</p>

<p>
"Who can she be?" thought Christie; "it is certainly
the same one I saw that night on the island, though she
was raving mad, and this one seems perfectly harmless.
I thought her a ghost that night, and fainted; and he had
to tell Aunt Tom some story of his own invention to
account for it."
</p>

<p>
The thought brought back the past so vividly to her
mind, that the maniac was forgotten, and, sitting down
on a fallen tree, she buried her face in her hands and
gave way to a passionate burst of grief.
</p>

<p>
It was soon over.  Christie's paroxysms of sorrow
never lasted long, but exhausted themselves by their very
violence, and she arose to survey the place which seemed
destined to be her future home.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful sylvan spot.  The cabin was built in
a sort of natural semi-circle, surrounded on all sides by
the dense primeval forest.  A smooth grass-plot sloped
gently, for some three yards in front of the house, and
then was broken on one side by clumps of bushes, and on
the other by a little clear, crystal stream, that danced
over the white pebbles, flashing like pearls in the
sunlight.  Behind the house, was a sort of vegetable garden,
with a narrow space reserved for flowers, betokening the
refined taste of the gardener.  The house itself was a low,
rough, unpretending looking cabin of the smallest and
plainest dimensions.  Not a sound broke the deep stillness,
save the musical ripple of the little stream, the
songs of the birds, the soft swaying of the trees, and
involuntarily, the deep peace of the scene passed into
Christie's heart, soothing it into calmness once more.
</p>

<p>
As she sat gazing around, a heavy footstep came
crashing through the trees, and the next moment her host
stood before her, with a gun in one hand, and a game-bag,
well filled, slung over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
He advanced to where she sat, looking surprised and
pleased to see her there.
</p>

<p>
"So thee has ventured out, my daughter!" he said,
with his kindly voice and kindlier smile.  "I am glad to
see thee able to leave thy room once more."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; the day was so fine and the sunshine so bright
and warm, I could not resist the temptation," said
Christie.  "I see you have been shooting with good success."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; game is plenty in our woods," he answered,
replacing his gun on a couple of hooks in the porch.
"But thee had better come in now; it is not good for
thee to sit too long in the hot sun, thee knows."
</p>

<p>
Christie rose half reluctantly and followed him into
the house.
</p>

<p>
The man drew a low wicker rocking-chair close to the
open window, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Sit thee there, child.  I know invalids, like thee, like
to rock back and forward; it's very quieting to the
feelings.  I must get the dinner, now."
</p>

<p>
"Let me help you," said Christie, anxious to be
useful.  "Let me get the dinner."
</p>

<p>
"By no means, daughter," said the man, with his
pleasant smile; "thee is too weak to work yet, and
besides, I have nothing else to do.  Sit thee down there,
for, now that thee is strong enough to bear it, I want to
have a little talk with thee."
</p>

<p>
Christie sank anxiously into the chair, and waited for
what was to come.  The man took a brace of partridges
out of his bag, and, placing them on the table, drew up
his chair, and began taking off the feathers and
conversing with Christie at the same time.
</p>

<p>
"First, my daughter, I should like to know what is
thy name?"
</p>

<p>
"Christie," was the response.
</p>

<p>
"Hast thee no other?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sometimes called Tomlinson, but that is not my
name.  I am an orphan, and live with my aunt."
</p>

<p>
"Where is thy native place?"
</p>

<p>
"Campbell's Island," said Christie, in a slightly
tremulous voice.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said the man, in some surprise, "if I had known
that I would not have brought thee here.  I thought thee
was a stranger.  Does thee belong to the Campbells?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; I lived with Mrs. Tom, the widow who
resides in the island."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I see," said the host, thoughtfully; "I have
seen the woman thee means.  But, how came thee, child,
to be lying stabbed on the beach that stormy night?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, there is a long story connected with that&mdash;which
at present, you must excuse my not telling.  I cannot
do so without involving others, and that I do not wish
to do," replied Christie, trying to steady her trembling
voice.
</p>

<p>
"As thee pleases, child, as thee pleases," said the man,
kindly.  "Do not speak of it, if it hurts thy feelings.  I
merely asked from the interest I take in thee.  But how
about returning to thy friends?  Thee wishes to do so, I
suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, no, no!" cried Christie, with involuntary
vehemence.  "Oh, I never wish to go back again!"
</p>

<p>
"Does thee not?" said her host, fixing his strong gray
eyes on her face in grave surprise.  "Thee has good
reasons for that, doubtless?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I have, I have!  Some day I will tell you all,
but not now.  I have no one to accuse or to blame; and
the only friends I have, have ceased to think of me as
living before this.  If I returned to them, there are many
who would be rendered miserable for life; and as they all
think me dead, I intend to be so to them."
</p>

<p>
All her courage gave way here, and bowing her face
in her hands, she gave way to one of her wild, passionate
bursts of tears.
</p>

<p>
The man's face expressed deep sympathy and compassion;
he did not speak nor interrupt her till the violence
of her sudden grief was abated, and then he inquired, in
his customary, quiet tone:
</p>

<p>
"And what does thee intend to do, my daughter?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know yet," said Christie, raising her head.
"I will go away somewhere and work for my living,
where I will never be heard of again."
</p>

<p>
"Poor little one, what can thee do for a living?" said
the man, compassionately.  "Thee is too small and delicate
to work, and never was made to buffet the storms of
this rough world."
</p>

<p>
"I will not have to wait long.  I will die!" said
Christie, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"That thee will, if thee takes thy place among the
workers in the outer circle of life.  So thee is fully
determined never to go back to thy friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, never, never!  I would rather die.  All I wish,
all I hope and pray for, is that they never discover I am
alive."
</p>

<p>
"Then stay with us; thee will not have to work at all,
and no one will ever hear of thee any more than if thee
wast thousands of miles away.  We are buried here in
the very heart of the forest, where people very rarely
come; and if any one did come, thee could easily be
concealed till he went away.  I know it is dull and lonely
here, but thee will get reconciled to that in time."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this is just what I wished, but I hardly dared
hope for!" exclaimed Christie, with sparkling eyes.
"How can I ever thank you for your generous offer?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not wish for thanks, my daughter; and thee
will oblige me, friend Christie, by not mentioning it
more.  Thou wilt be very useful, and can take care of
Bertha, who is insane, but quite harmless.  Thou hast
seen her, has thee not?"
</p>

<p>
"The handsome woman with the dark hair and eyes?
Yes," replied Christie.
</p>

<p>
"Then that is settled," said the man, with a smile;
"and now that I have questioned thee, it is thy turn.
Does thee wish to ask something?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, ever so many things," said Christie; "but I
am afraid you may not like&mdash;that you may be offended."
</p>

<p>
"There is no danger of that, my daughter.  I may not
choose to answer some of thy questions, but I will not be
offended, let thee say what thee will."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," said Christie, with a faint smile, "to
begin catechising alter the same fashion as yourself, may
I ask your name and that of the lady who lives here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; her name is Bertha Campbell&mdash;mine is Reuben
Deerwood; thee may call me Uncle Reuben, if thee
likes."
</p>

<p>
"Then she is no relation to you?"
</p>

<p>
"She is my cousin&mdash;no more."
</p>

<p>
"Once before," said Christie, hesitatingly, "I asked
you about how you came to be on the island that stormy
night.  You did not tell me then.  May I repeat the
question now?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  Bertha, though usually quiet, has certain
paroxysms of violence, during which, with the usual
cunning of insanity, she sometimes eludes my vigilance and
escapes.  On these occasions she goes down to the shore,
takes a boat, and goes over to the island.  I, of course,
follow her; and it was one of these times I happened to be
there.  That afternoon she had gone over, and was
wandering through the pine woods.  I went after her, and
just reached the island as that furious storm came on.  I
wandered around for a long time without finding her, and
in my search, somewhere about midnight, I providentially
chanced to reach the spot where thee lay wounded and
exposed to the fury of the storm.  The tide was rising on
the shore, and five minutes later thee would have been
swept away.  I lifted thee in my arms and carried thee
down to the boat, instead of following my first intention
of leaving thee at the cottage or at Campbell's Lodge.  I
did not wish to let it be known I was on the island.  Then
I heard a voice screaming 'Murder!' and knew it must be
Bertha; so I set off to look for her again, and found her
just coming out of the lodge.  I had to bind her hand and
foot and tie a handkerchief over her mouth to keep her
quiet; and there I waited till the storm had abated.
</p>

<p>
"It was near noon the next day when we reached the
shore, a quarter of a mile below here; and Bertha's
paroxysm being over, she followed me quietly home, while
I carried thee.  I feared thee was dead for a long time,
and only I happened to have some knowledge of surgery,
thee never would have recovered.  That is the whole
history," said Uncle Reuben, rising with a smile, and
hanging his partridges over the fire to roast.
</p>

<p>
A light had broken on the mind of Christie while he
spoke.  This woman must be the apparition that had so
often been seen on the isle, and had given it the name of
being haunted.
</p>

<p>
"May I ask," she said, eagerly, "if this&mdash;if Bertha has
been in the habit of visiting the island?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, such is her habit at times," said Reuben,
gravely.  "About the full of the moon she gets these
bad turns, and generally makes her escape to the island,
though sometimes I prevent her.  Has thee ever seen
her there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, once," said Christie; "but I thought she was a
spirit."
</p>

<p>
"More than thee has thought that, friend Christie;
but thee need not be afraid of her; she is perfectly
harmless."
</p>

<p>
"Why is it she always goes to the island at such
times?" said Christie, curiously.
</p>

<p>
The man's face clouded.
</p>

<p>
"There is a long story connected with that, my
daughter&mdash;a sad story of wrong and crime.  Some day I will
tell it to thee, if thee reminds me of it."
</p>

<p>
"How long has she been insane?"
</p>

<p>
"Nearly fourteen years."
</p>

<p>
"A long time, indeed.  I should like to hear her
history very much.  Do you not fear she has gone to the
island now?  I saw her go into the woods an hour ago."
</p>

<p>
"No; she has only gone for a stroll through the trees,
or to look for berries; she will soon be back&mdash;and here
she is," he added, as the woman Bertha abruptly entered,
her kitten still in her arms; and, without looking or
speaking to either of them, she sat down on a low stool
and began sorting some pine cones held in her lap.
</p>

<p>
All this time the man Reuben had been getting dinner
and setting the table, proving himself to be as good a
cook as a nurse.  In a few minutes it was smoking on
the table, and then he went over, and, touching the
woman on the shoulder, said gently:
</p>

<p>
"Is thee ready for dinner, Bertha?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, rising promptly and taking her seat.
</p>

<p>
Christie took the place pointed out to her, and Uncle
Reuben, taking the head of the table, did the honors.
</p>

<p>
Then, when the meal was over, Bertha resumed her
stool and her pine cones; Christie took the rocking-chair
by the window, and Reuben busied himself in clearing
away the dinner dishes and setting things to rights.
</p>

<p>
Weak still, and exhausted by the efforts of the morning,
Christie threw herself on her bed during the course
of the afternoon, and fell into the profound and refreshing
sleep of bodily weariness, from which she did not
awaken until the bustle of preparing supper aroused
her.
</p>

<p>
In the evening Reuben took down an old, antiquated-looking
Bible and read a few chapters aloud, and then
they all retired to their separate couches.
</p>

<p>
And thus began Christie's new life&mdash;a life of endless
monotony, but one of perfect peace.  As the days passed
on, bringing with them no change or excitement, she
gradually settled down into a sort of dreamy lethargy,
disturbed now and then as some circumstance would
forcibly recall all she had loved and lost forever, by
short, passionate outbursts of grief, but which were
always followed by a deeper and more settled melancholy
than before.

CHAPTER XXV.
<br><br>
THE MANIAC'S STORY.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "All was confused and undefined<br>
  In her all-jarred and wandering mind;<br>
  A chaos of wild hopes and fears&mdash;<br>
  And now in laughter, now in tears,<br>
  But madly still in each extreme,<br>
  She strove with that convulsive dream."&mdash;BYRON.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Autumn was at hand.  The woods were gorgeous
in their radiant robes of gold, and purple, and
crimson.  Christie's chief pleasure was in wandering
through the forest, and gazing on the brilliant
jewelry of Nature.  The weeks that had passed, had
restored her to health; but her step had not regained its
elastic lightness; her voice had lost its old joyous tones;
her once roseate cheek had lost forever its vivid bloom;
and the bright, joyous light of hope and happiness had
died out in the deep, melancholy, blue eyes.  She moved
through the little forest cabin, the shadow of her former
self, pale, wan, and spiritual.  And in looking at her
slight, delicate figure, her fair, transparent little face,
with its sad, haunting eyes, you might have thought her
some fair vision of another world, and almost expect to
see her fade away before your very eyes.
</p>

<p>
It was very lonesome, buried there in the depths of
the forest, with no companions but the man Reuben and
the maniac Bertha.  But its very loneliness made it all
the more welcome to our little recluse, who dreaded
nothing so much as a discovery; and in roaming through the
grand old woods, she felt she never wanted to leave this
solitary spot again.  At any other time she would have
shrank in terror from the prospect of passing the long,
dreary winter here, when even the comfort of these walks
would be denied her.  How little did she dream of all
that was to occur before that winter came.
</p>

<p>
Reuben's journeys to N&mdash;&mdash; to buy necessaries for the
little family, were the only incidents that broke the
unvarying monotony of their life.  At first, Christie had been
somewhat afraid of remaining alone with Bertha; but,
finding she was, as Reuben had said, perfectly
harmless&mdash;sitting for hours together playing with her kitten&mdash;she
had soon recovered from this fear.  Love was a necessity
of Christie's life, and as time passed, she learned to love
Bertha with a deep, earnest love that sometimes surprised
even herself.  The maniac, too, in her fitful, uncertain
way, seemed to return this love, and would sit for half a
day at a time, with her head lying in Christie's lap, and
the vacant, childish smile on her face.
</p>

<p>
As for Reuben, no one could know him, with his simple
goodness and benevolence, without loving him; and
Christie already loved and revered him as a father, while
he felt an affection for his little stray waif, second only
to that which he felt for Bertha.
</p>

<p>
As yet, he had not told her the history of the maniac;
and Christie, for the most part, absorbed in her own sad
thoughts, had almost forgotten it; but one cold and
blustering night, as she drew her low rocking-chair up to
the fire, while her nimble fingers busily flew in making
some warm clothing for the winter, she reminded him of
his promise, and urged him to relate it.
</p>

<p>
Bertha had already retired, and lay asleep in her bed
in the corner of the kitchen; and Reuben, his day's work
done, sat opposite Christie, making wicker-baskets, which
he was in the habit of taking to N&mdash;&mdash; at intervals, to
sell, and which constituted the principal income of the
family.
</p>

<p>
"It seems a sad thing to recall days so long past,"
said Reuben, with a sigh; "but thee deserves to know,
Christie, for waiting so long, patiently.  And, my
daughter, when thee hears, thee may think it strange that
there should be so much wickedness in this world; but
the Lord will redeem His servants in His own good
time."
</p>

<p>
"Let me see; it requires time to look so far back.
My father was a farmer living in Connecticut, and
belonged to the Society of Friends.  He had a brother, it
seems&mdash;a wild youth, who ran away at the age of sixteen,
and went to sea.  Eight years passed before they received
any news whether he was living or dead, and then a letter
came to my father from him, saying he was in Spain, in a
place called Grenada, and was married to a Spanish girl
of that place.
</p>

<p>
"After that, for fourteen years more, we heard nothing
else from him, until one cold winter's night, as we
were all sitting round the fire, there came a knock at the
door, and when one of my sisters opened it, a man,
dressed like a sailor, entered, leading a little girl of
twelve years by the hand.  That man was my father's
long-absent brother, whose wife was dead, and who
wished to place the child with his friends before he went
to sea again.  That child is now the maniac Bertha thee
sees on that bed."
</p>

<p>
Uncle Reuben's lips quivered a little as his eyes fell
on the still beautiful face of the sleeper, and Christie
listened with a look of the deepest interest.
</p>

<p>
"Bertha, though only a child then," said Uncle
Reuben, resuming his work, "was taller and more womanly
looking than many girls of sixteen, with the most beautiful
face thee ever saw in thy life.  My three sisters were
then accounted very handsome girls by everybody, but
they were no more to be compared to her than candles
are to stars.  They had fine, healthy features, and red
cheeks, and round, merry faces, but she had a dark, oval
face, with long, beautiful black curls, and large,
melancholy, dark eyes.  Ah, my daughter, thee looks as if thee
thought her beautiful still, but she is nothing now to what
she was then.
</p>

<p>
"Bertha could speak very little English then&mdash;hardly
a word&mdash;and I remember how the villagers used to laugh
at her attempts to talk with them; but when they looked
at her mourning-dress, and sad, beautiful face, their
laughter quickly ceased.
</p>

<p>
"Her father, who, though not rich, had some money,
wished her to be sent to some good boarding-school,
where she could acquire a good education.  He was going
off on some voyage, in which he expected to make his
fortune; and when he came back, he said Bertha should
be a great lady.
</p>

<p>
"Accordingly, three weeks after she came, she was
sent away to a boarding-school, and I do not think there
was one sorrier to bid her good-by then than I was.  Her
father the next day went away in his ship, destined to
some far-off place, which he was never doomed to reach,
for a month after news came that the vessel was wrecked,
and all hands cast away; so that Bertha had now no
living relatives in this country except us.
</p>

<p>
"As her father before he went had made abundant
provision for her schooling, in case anything should
happen, Bertha remained five years at school.  We saw very
little of her all this time, for she mostly spent her
vacations with her friends, the school girls; but when the
period of her stay had elapsed, she came back to the old
homestead.  We had parted from her a beautiful child,
but she returned a woman&mdash;peerless, superb&mdash;a perfect
vision of beauty.  Everybody was raving about her.  All
the young men, far and near, were in love with her; but
Bertha never seemed to care for any of them, and used to
spend her time embroidering, or reading, or playing on
the guitar, and singing Spanish songs about 'beautiful
Grenada.'  I was a young man then, about seven-and-twenty
years of age; and I, too, like the rest fell in love
with my beautiful, dark-eyed cousin.  It was a hopeless
love, and I knew it.  I felt that she was as far above me
as heaven is above the earth, and I locked my secret in
my own bosom, and resolved I would never give her a
moment's pain by telling her of it.
</p>

<p>
"I was, however, her favorite; there were two more
brothers, but she liked me best&mdash;but only with a sisterly
love.  To me alone she used to speak of the vine-clad
hills of Spain; of her beautiful dead mother, and of her
longings for sunny Grenada once more.  And I used to
sit and listen, and sympathize with her, and keep down
the yearning desire that used to fill my heart to kneel at
her feet and ask her to give me the right to take her
there.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, little Christie, thee may wonder how such a
rough, uncouth man as I am could ever feel love like
this; but I could have died then for my beautiful cousin,
though she, nor no one else, ever dreamed I cherished for
her other than a cousinly affection.  When I used to see
her smile on other young men, and lean on their arms,
and listen, and look pleased when they talked, and blush
when she would meet their eyes, I used to feel the demon
of jealousy rising within me; and then I would be forced
to tear myself away from them all, lest my looks or
actions might betray me.  It was very hard then to bear
my lot patiently; but, when, after a while, Bertha would
come back to me, and tell me how tiresome they all were,
and that I was the dearest, best cousin in the world, and
worth all the other young men she knew put together, I
used to feel recompensed for it all, and I could have knelt
down at her very feet in gratitude for the words.
</p>

<p>
"These were the happiest days of my life, little friend;
and though I knew Bertha could never love me, yet I felt
if I might only be near her, and know she was happy, and
see her smile on me sometimes, I could even bear to see
her married to some man more worthy of her than I was.
I do not say there were not times when I was tempted to
murmur and wish Heaven had gifted me with a less
ungainly form, for Bertha's sake; yet, I think, I may say,
I strove to subdue all such ungrateful murmurs, and
think of my many blessings; and, on the whole, I was
happy.
</p>

<p>
"My father, who was growing old and infirm, loved
Bertha, with a passionate fondness, and often spoke of
his cherished wish of seeing her united to one of his sons.
I was the oldest, and his favorite, and I knew his ardent
desire was to see us married; but as this could never be,
I always strove to evade giving a direct answer to his
questions concerning my feelings toward my cousin.  To
her he had never spoken on the subject; but on his
deathbed he called us to him, and putting her hand in mine,
charged us to love one another, and become husband and
wife.  Ah! there was little need to tell me to love one
I almost worshiped already.  Bertha's hand lay passively
in mine.  She was weeping convulsively, and neither of
us would render his last moments unhappy by saying his
dearest wish could not be fulfilled.  I thought then that
she had merely acquiesced to soothe his dying moments,
and resolved, much as I loved her, not to bind her by any
such promise.  But in the bustle and confusion of the
next three day, there was no time for explanation, and
the funeral was over before I could even speak a word to
her in private.
</p>

<p>
"The day after the funeral I found her sitting alone in
a sort of arbor, at the foot of the garden; and going up
to her I said, with abrupt haste, for every word seemed to
stick in my throat:
</p>

<p>
"'Bertha, I knew thee did not like to refuse my
father's dying request to marry me; but as the promise
was given against thy will, I have taken the first opportunity
of telling thee I do not consider it binding, and so
far as I am concerned, thou may consider thyself quite free
from all engagement to me.'
</p>

<p>
"I did not dare to gaze at her, as she sat there,
looking so sweet and beautiful, lest my resolution should
falter; and I turned away, and was about to leave, when
her voice recalled me.
</p>

<p>
"'Do you wish our engagement broken, Cousin
Reuben?' she said, softly.
</p>

<p>
"'Wish it!' I cried out, forgetting prudence, resolution,
everything but her.  'Oh, Bertha, I love you better
than all the world!'
</p>

<p>
"'Then take me for your wife,' she said, coming over
and pushing back the hair from my face.  She kissed me
and was gone.
</p>

<p>
"For a while I could not tell whether I was sleeping
or waking, her words seemed so unreal.  I stood like one
in a trance; like one in some blissful dream, from which
he fears to awaken.  I could not realize that this
peerlessly beautiful girl could be willing to marry me&mdash;a
rough, homely, plodding farmer.  I resolutely shut my
heart against the bewildering conviction; but that evening,
when we sat alone together, and I asked her to repeat
what she had said, she smiled at my incredulity, and told
me she intended to be my wife just as soon as our term
of mourning expired, and that I might make known our
engagement as soon as I liked.
</p>

<p>
"'It will save me from being persecuted by the attentions
of other young men, you know, Cousin Reuben,'
she said.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody was surprised when they heard of it, for
she had rejected richer and far handsomer men; and for
a while people refused to believe it.  But when they saw
us always together, and Bertha quietly confirmed the
report, they were forced to the conviction that it really
was true, and I was looked upon as the most fortunate
and enviable of men.
</p>

<p>
"The next six months I was the happiest man in the
world; and in nine more we were to be married, and go
on a tour to Spain.  It seemed too much happiness for
me.  I could not realize that it would ever prove true;
and, alas! it never did.
</p>

<p>
"One day there came a letter from a school friend of
Bertha's who lived in Westport, inviting her there on a
visit.  Bertha wished to go, and no one opposed her; but
I saw her set out, with a sad forboding that this visit
would prove fatal to my new-found happiness.
</p>

<p>
"Three months passed away before Bertha came back.
She used to write to us at first long, gay, merry letters,
telling us all about the place, and the people she met;
but gradually her letters grew shorter, and more reserved,
and less frequent, and for a month before her return,
ceased altogether.
</p>

<p>
"I was half-crazed with anxiety, doubts, and apprehensions;
and was about to set out for Westport to see if
anything had happened, when one day the Stage stopped
at the door, and Bertha alighted.  Yes, Bertha&mdash;but so
changed I hardly knew her; pale, cold, and reserved;
she sang and laughed no longer; but used to sit for
hours, her head on her hand, thinking and thinking.
Bertha was bodily with us; but in spirit she was far
away&mdash;<i>where</i>, I dared not ask.  She hardly ever spoke
now, but sat by herself in her own room, except at
mealtimes.  From me she shrank with a sort of dread,
mingled with shame, coloring, and averting her head,
when she met my eye; and, much as I loved her, I used
ever after that to shun meeting her, lest it should give
her pain.
</p>

<p>
"But oh, Christie, what it cost me to do this, may thee
never know!  I saw she repented her promise, given in
a moment of impulsive generosity; and I resolved that
that promise I would never call upon her to redeem.
</p>

<p>
"One morning she made her appearance at the breakfast-table,
looking pale, wild, and terrified.  We all
thought she was ill, but she said she was not; she had
had bad dreams, she said, forcing a smile, and a headache,
but a walk in the breezy morning air would cure that.
</p>

<p>
"After breakfast as I stood leaning against a tree,
thinking sadly of all I had lost, she came up to me, and
laying her hand on my shoulder, said:
</p>

<p>
"'Cousin Reuben, I have seemed cold and distant to
you for the past few days, and I fear I have offended you.
Can you forgive me?'
</p>

<p>
"She spoke hurriedly, and with a certain wildness in
her manner, but I did not notice it then.  I thought she
was about to be my own Bertha again, and how readily
that forgiveness was given, I need not tell thee.  She
stooped down and kissed my hand while I spoke, and
then, without a word, started off down the street at a
rapid walk, from which she never came back."
</p>

<p>
Uncle Reuben paused, and his hands trembled so that
for a moment he could not go on with his work.  Then,
recovering himself, he continued:
</p>

<p>
"All that day passed, and she did not return; and
when night came we began to wonder at her delay.  Still,
we were not uneasy, for we thought she had stopped all
night at the house of some friend; but the next day
passed, and the next, and nothing more was heard of
her.  Then we grew alarmed; and I was about to rouse
the neighborhood and go in search of her, when a letter
was brought to me in her well-known writing.
</p>

<p>
"A terrible thought flashed across my mind at the sight.
I sank into a chair, tore it open, and read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"'COUSIN REUBEN:&mdash;I have gone&mdash;fled from you all
forever.  Do not search for me, for it will be useless.  I
cannot ask you to forgive me, I have wronged you too
deeply for that; but do not curse the memory of the
unworthy
</p>

<p class="noindent">
'BERTHA.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Every word of that note is ineffaceably burned in
my heart and brain.  In that moment my whole life and
destiny were changed.  I did not show the note to a
living soul.  I rose up and told them to hush their clamors,
and never to mention her name more.  I think my looks
must have frightened them, for they drew back in silence;
and I put on my hat, and without speaking a word,
walked out of the house.
</p>

<p>
"The moment I had read the words, my resolution
was taken.  I determined to go forth and seek for her till
she was found, and tell her, with my own lips, that I
forgave her all.  In a week I had arranged my affairs.  I
left to my second brother the farm, and without telling
him where I was going, or what was my object, I left
home, and never saw it more.
</p>

<p>
"I went to Westport.  I felt sure I would find her
there, and I was right.  Just one week after my arrival,
as I was out taking a stroll through the town, one night
about dusk, a woman, dressed in deep black and closely
veiled, brushed hastily by me.  I started as if I had
received a galvanic shock; for, though the vail hid her
face, there was no mistaking that tall, regal form and
quick, proud step.  I knew I had found Bertha.  I turned
and followed her.  I overtook her, and laying my hand
on her arm, said:
</p>

<p>
"'Cousin Bertha!'
</p>

<p>
"At the sudden sound of my voice, she started and
shrieked aloud, and would have fallen if I had not
supported her.  Fortunately, the street was almost deserted,
and no one noticed us; and I drew her arm within mine,
and said:
</p>

<p>
"'Fear not, Bertha; I have only sought you out to
tell you I forgive you for the past.'
</p>

<p>
"'And you can forgive me after all I have done&mdash;after
so cruelly, so deeply wronging you!  Oh, Cousin
Reuben!' she cried out passionately.
</p>

<p>
"'Hush! thee will be heard,' I said, softly.  'I am thy
brother now, Bertha.  Where does thee live?  I will go
with thee, and, if thou art willing to tell me, I will hear
your story.'
</p>

<p>
"She tried to speak, but something seemed to choke
her, and we hurried on in silence until we reached the
hotel where she stopped.  When we were in her room
she sank down at my feet, and, holding up her hands,
cried out:
</p>

<p>
"'Once again&mdash;once again, say you forgive me!  Oh,
Cousin Reuben, I cannot believe what I have heard!'
</p>

<p>
"She looked so pale and haggard, that I felt I had
more to pity than forgive.  I raised her up and said:
</p>

<p>
"'I have nothing to forgive, Bertha.  Look on me as
a brother, and while I live I will ever regard thee as a
dear sister.'
</p>

<p>
"What she said then, and how wildly she talked and
wept, I need not tell thee now.  I waited till she was
calm, but it was long before she was composed enough to
tell me her story, and then I learned she was already a
wife, though no one knew it but myself, her husband, and
the clergyman who had united them.
</p>

<p>
"Thee has heard of Mark Campbell, the late owner of
the lodge&mdash;a man feared by all, and loved by few?  It
was to him she was married.  His first wife had been
dead some years, and he resided with his young son and
daughter on the island.  He had met Bertha during her
stay in Westport, and had fallen violently in love with
her.  He was a tall, stalwart, handsome man, as all his
race ever were, and she returned his passion with all the
fierce impetuosity for which those of her nation have ever
been distinguished.  But he was proud, very proud, and
arrogant, like all the Campbells, and would not stoop to
marry a girl so far beneath him publicly.  Thee knows I
told thee she was only a sailor's daughter, and an
unknown foreigner besides.  He gave her some plausible
reason&mdash;I forget what&mdash;and urged a private marriage.
She loved him, and was easily persuaded, and, though
unknown to the world, was Mark Campbell's wife.
</p>

<p>
"I promised not to reveal her secret; but I felt that a
marriage with such a passionate, vindictive man, could
be productive only of misery and sorrow to her.  She had
no friend in the world but me, and I resolved to remain
in Westport and watch over her safety.
</p>

<p>
"So nearly two years passed.  Bertha dwelt sometimes
in Westport, and sometimes on the island.  Campbell's
Lodge, thee knows, is a large house, full of rooms
and passages, and she could easily remain there for
weeks at a time without being discovered.  Mark Campbell
had a schooner, and kept five or six rough-looking
sailor fellows, half smugglers and whole villains,
constantly about him.  I managed to obtain employment
about the place, and was enabled to remain on the island,
and, unsuspected, watch over Bertha.
</p>

<p>
"Bertha, when on the island, always lived in some of
the upper rooms where the children and servants never
came.  One day, when she was in Westport, I chanced to
have some errand to those apartments, and entering a
little dark closet off one of the large rooms, I knelt down
to grope for something on the floor, when my hand
pressed heavily on something which I knew now to be a
spring; a trap-door fell, and I came very near being
precipitated twelve feet to one of the rooms below&mdash;a large,
empty apartment, filled with old lumber.
</p>

<p>
"When I had recovered from my astonishment at this
unexpected occurrence, I examined the trap, and found
it could be opened from below, and that, owing to the
darkness of the closet, when shut it could never be
discovered.  I was at no loss to account for its object, as it
had evidently been constructed by some former occupant
for no good purpose.  I felt convinced, however, that
the present proprietor knew nothing of it, or long ere
this it would have been made use of; and I resolved to
say nothing about it, not knowing for what evil end he
might use it.
</p>

<p>
"I was right when I felt that this hasty marriage
between Bertha and Mark Campbell could be productive
of nothing but misery.  Already he was wearying of her,
but that did not prevent him from being madly jealous.
A stranger, a mere youth, and the handsomest I ever saw,
had met Bertha somewhere, and was deeply struck by
her beauty.  He was a gay, thoughtless lad, and Mark
Campbell, overhearing some speeches he had made about
her, had all the fierce jealousy of his nature aroused.  He
set spies to watch Bertha; her every word and look was
distorted, after the fashion of jealous people, into a
confirmation of her guilt, and poor Bertha led a wretched
life of it.  Her only comfort now was her little daughter,
of whom I had forgotten to tell thee before.
</p>

<p>
"One night one of his spies came to the island and
sought an interview with Mark Campbell.  What its
purport was I know not; but when it was ended his face
was livid&mdash;absolutely diabolical with passion.  Two of
his villainous crew were dispatched in a boat to Westport;
and when they returned they brought with them this
youth, gagged and bound hand and foot.  Bertha was at
the time dwelling in the lodge, for Campbell was too
madly jealous to suffer her to go out of his sight.
</p>

<p>
"I had a presentiment that something terrible would
occur that night, but I never dreamed of the awful
murder that was perpetrated in one of the upper rooms.  It
was a stormy, tempestuous night, but the men were sent
off again to a little sea-coast village some miles below
N&mdash;&mdash;, and when they came back they had with them
another man, gagged and bound like the first.
</p>

<p>
"I could not rest that night, but sat anxiously in my
room, in the basement story, longing with a strange dread
for the morning.  I felt sure some evil was meditated,
and as I listened I suddenly heard one wild, terrific shriek,
which I knew must be Bertha's.  Half mad with terror, I
fled from the room and stole into the lower hall to listen,
but all was perfectly still.  For upward of half an hour I
remained thus; but nothing broke the deep stillness
until heavy footsteps began to descend the stairs, and I
saw the two worst of Campbell's gang coming down, and
leading between them the man they had last brought to
the isle.  They placed him in a boat and rowed away,
and I returned to the house, still ignorant of what had
transpired.  As I approached it I saw two others of the
crew talking in low, hushed voices as they descended to
the shore.  I stole behind them to listen, and judge of my
horror when I learned that, in his frantic jealousy,
Campbell had murdered this stranger youth, and in his infernal
barbarity had cast his loving wife and the murdered body
of her supposed lover into a room together&mdash;consigning
her to a death too fearful to contemplate.  The man who
had just been taken away was a mason, who had been
procured to wall up the only door to the room.
</p>

<p>
"I listened, my very life-blood freezing with horror;
but judge of my feelings when, from their description of
the room, I knew it to be the one with the hidden door.
In that instant everything was forgotten but the one
thought of freeing her who was dearer still to me than
life.  I was more like a frantic man than one sane.  I
procured a ladder, made my way noiselessly into the
deserted lumber room, ascended it, and carefully let fall
the trap.  The lifeless form of the murdered man lay
across the opening, but I pushed it aside and sprang into
the room, thinking only of Bertha.  In the farthest corner,
crouching down to the floor, she sat, a glibbering idiot.
The terrible shock had driven her insane.
</p>

<p>
"What I felt at that dreadful sight no words can ever
tell.  I raised her in my arms and bore her, unresisting,
down into the lumber-room.  I closed the trap, concealed
the ladder, and carrying her as if she were an infant,
I fled from the accursed spot.  She neither spoke nor
uttered a single cry, but lay passively in my arms.  There
were boats on the shore; I placed her in one, and with a
strength that seemed almost superhuman rowed over the
heaving waves till morning.  Whither I was going I
knew not, neither did I care; my only object was to bear
her beyond the reach of her deadly enemy.
</p>

<p>
"When morning came, I found myself on the shore,
below this place.  I had often been here, and admired
this quiet and hidden spot, buried in the depths of the
wood.  Here I bore Bertha, who followed me like a
child; and, before noon I had constructed a sort of rude
hut, to screen her from the heat of the sun and the night
dew.  Then I went to N&mdash;&mdash; for such necessaries as I
immediately required, and resolved, that here I would
spend my life in watching over my poor, insane cousin.
</p>

<p>
"It would be dull, tedious, and uninteresting to relate
how I labored for the next few weeks, to construct this
hut, and form, as best I could, the rude furniture you see
here.  It was a labor of love, and I heeded not fatigue
nor want of rest, until it was completed.  No child in the
arms of its nurse could be more quiet and docile than
Bertha, but I saw that reason had fled forever.  I fancied
she would always remain thus still and gentle, and never
dreamed she could be attacked by paroxysms of violence,
like other lunatics; until one night, I was startled to find
her raving mad, flying through the house and shrieking
murder.  All the events of that terrible night seemed to
come back to her, and she fled from the house before I
could detain her, sprang into the boat, and put off for the
island.  She knew how to manage a boat, and before I
could reach N&mdash;&mdash; and procure another, she had reached
the island, entered Campbell's Lodge, still making the
air resound with her shrill shrieks of murder.  Fortunately,
in the dark, she was not perceived, and I managed
to seize her and bear her off to the boat before any one
beheld her.
</p>

<p>
"A fortnight after, when I visited N&mdash;&mdash;, I learned
that Mark Campbell was dead; and, I knew that he must
have heard her cries, and supposing them to be
supernatural, the shock had hastened his death.
</p>

<p>
"Of Bertha's child, I could discover nothing.  How
he disposed of it is unknown to me to this hour.
</p>

<p>
"And so, Bertha and I have lived here for fourteen
years, unmolested, and our very existence is doubtless
long since forgotten.  She is, as you see her, gentle and
harmless; but, she still has those periodical attacks of
violence, but in a lesser degree than at first.  At such
times, by some strange instinct, or glimmering of reason,
she always seeks the isle, enters Campbell's Lodge, and
goes wandering through the rooms, as if vacantly trying
to remember something that is past.  These nocturnal
visits have given the lodge the reputation of being
haunted, which her appearance at different times upon
the isle has confirmed.  As the house was for several
years deserted, except by some old servants, after the
death of Mark Campbell, she could roam with impunity
through the rooms&mdash;sometimes even pushing back bolts
and entering apartments that were locked.  Such,
Christie, is the story of the maniac Bertha."
</p>

<p>
All this time Christie had been listening, with a look
of the deepest, most absorbed attention, in silent
amazement at all she heard.  The mystery of the haunted house
and the spirit of the isle, was cleared up at last.
</p>

<p>
"And the child&mdash;did you never hear anything more of
it?" inquired Christie.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing concerning it have I ever heard."
</p>

<p>
"Then it may be still alive."
</p>

<p>
"It is very probable; villain as he was, he would not
slay his own child.  But enough of this; it is wearing
late, and thee looks tired, Christie.  Good-night, my
daughter."
</p>

<p>
Christie sought her couch, to wonder and dream over
what she had heard, and forget for a time her own griefs
in thinking of the greater ones of poor Bertha.  How
similar, too, seemed their fate!  The sufferings of both
had originated in those fatal secret marriages.  Bertha's
were over, but Christie's were not; and wondering how
hers were to end, Christie fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
And thus days, and weeks, and months glided by in
the little, lonely, forest cottage.  The long, dreary winter
passed, and spring was again robing the trees in green,
while the inmates of the cottage knew nothing of the
events passing in the great world, more than if they no
longer dwelt in it&mdash;dreamed not of the startling denouement
to the tragedy of the isle that was even then hastening
to a close; until their peace was broken by an
unexpected occurrence that roused Christie into electric life
once more.
</p>

<p>
But for the present we must leave her, and return to
the other scenes and characters of our story.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br><br>
REMORSE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Oh, tell me, father, can the dead<br>
  Walk on the earth and look on us,<br>
  And lay upon the living's head<br>
  Their blessing or their curse?<br>
  She comes to me each night&mdash;<br>
  The dried leaves do not feel her tread;<br>
  She stands by me, in the deep midnight,<br>
  In the white robes of the dead."&mdash;WHITTIER.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And now we must return to the day following that
night of storm and crime on the shore of Campbell's
Isle.
</p>

<p>
When Edgar awoke to consciousness once more, he
found himself lying on a lounge, with some one chafing
his hands and temples.  Unable for a moment to realize
what had happened, he started up and gazed wildly
around.
</p>

<p>
The first object on which his eyes rested was the pale,
anxious face of his wife, as she bent over him.
</p>

<p>
That sight brought back all.  With a hollow, unearthly
groan, he fell back, exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
"Heaven and earth! has the grave given up its dead?
Or am I dead, with my victim confronting me in another
world?"
</p>

<p>
But, at the sound of his voice, Laura uttered a joyful
cry, and falling on her knees beside him, clasped her
arms round his neck, crying out:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edgar! dearest Edgar! thank Heaven you are
still alive!  Oh, Edgar, I was made reckless.  Only
forgive me for the miserable past, and, as Heaven hears me,
I will never, never make you so wretched more!"
</p>

<p>
Her tone, her look, her clasp, convinced him she was
really alive.  With his brain burning and throbbing as
though he were going mad, he started up and grasped
her by the arm, while he fairly shrieked:
</p>

<p>
"Woman, do I speak to the living or the dead?  Did
I not murder you?"
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Edgar, no!  The fall scarcely hurt me at
all.  It was all my own fault.  Do not think of it any
more, and do not speak or look so crazed and excited.
Do you not see I am alive and well?"
</p>

<p>
Yes, he saw it.  She whom he supposed was buried
forever in the heaving sea was bending over him, holding
his frenzied head on her breast, pushing back the wild
black hair soothingly off his burning brow.
</p>

<p>
Was he sane or mad?  Were all the events of the
previous night only the horrible delusion of a dream&mdash;the
vivid deception of a nightmare?  Was the storm, the
murder, all a mocking unreality?
</p>

<p>
He looked down and saw on his cloak a dark, clotted
mark, the maddening evidence of the past, and knew that
it was not a dream.  His wife was living, still.  Who,
then, had fallen by his hand?  In the storm and darkness,
what horrible mistake had he made?
</p>

<p>
He ground his teeth and clenched his hands together
to keep back the terrible emotions that made his very
brain reel, feeling as though nothing, in that moment,
could inflict greater tortures than he endured.
</p>

<p>
Dreaming not of what was passing in his mind, Laura
still bent over, caressing him, and striving to soothe him
back to calmness, bitterly accusing herself for her
heartless conduct, that had driven him to such a depth of
misery and despair.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edgar! my dearest husband! only say you forgive
me for the past!  I have done you wrong, but I
never meant to torture you thus.  Oh! indeed, I never&mdash;never
meant it!  I will do anything, be anything, go anywhere
you wish for the future.  Dearest Edgar, will you
not say you pardon me?"
</p>

<p>
"Leave me&mdash;-leave me!" groaned the unhappy man,
averting his head, and shading his eyes with his hands.
</p>

<p>
"But say you forgive me first, Edgar!  Oh! if you
knew what a miserable night I have passed, you would
think I had atoned sufficiently for what I have done."
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you&mdash;where were you last night?" he cried,
with sudden wildness, starting up.
</p>

<p>
"I was here, of course.  For Heaven's sake, Edgar, do
not excite yourself so," she said, startled and alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"Were you here all night?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Edgar.  If I had been inclined to go out,
I was not able; and if able and inclined, I could not have
done so in such a storm.  Do compose yourself,
Mr. Courtney."
</p>

<p>
"You are <i>sure</i> you were here <i>all</i> night?"
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly I was.  Why will you persist in asking
me such a question?" she said, in extreme surprise.
Again he fell back with a shuddering groan.  "Dear
Edgar, you are very ill.  I must send for a physician,"
said Laura, in great alarm, thinking his violent jealousy
had unsettled his brain.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no! on your peril, <i>no</i>!" he vehemently
exclaimed.  "Leave me! all I want, all I ask for, is to be
alone!"
</p>

<p>
"But you have not yet forgiven me.  Will you not do
so before I go?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes, anything, only leave me."
</p>

<p>
Sighing deeply, Mrs. Courtney arose, and pressing a
kiss on his brow, left the room.
</p>

<p>
And he was alone&mdash;alone with his own frenzied,
tumultuous thoughts&mdash;alone with his own conscience, the
most terrific companion a guilty man can have.  Again
came the torturing thought, What, oh, what had he done?
Whom, in his mad passion, had he slain?  While reason
and judgment slept, and jealousy and blind frenzy raged,
what wrong had he committed?
</p>

<p>
But his wife lived.  With a sudden revulsion of feeling,
in all the tempest of agony and remorse, that conviction
was the one gleam of blessed sunlight in the dark
night of despair.  Come what might, she who had given
up all for him, had not fallen by his hand; her death was
not on his soul.  And he drew a deep breath of relief;
and, if he had dared to breathe the holy name, would
have thanked Heaven for her preservation.
</p>

<p>
How strongly amidst the wildest chaos of doubt and
anguish does the instinct of self-preservation ever remain
in the ascendant.  All other thoughts quickly passed
away, and the one absorbing idea of securing his own
safety filled his whole breast.  He thought, with a start
of alarm, what conjectures his strange questions and
wild excitement must have given rise to in the mind of
his wife, and resolved that, for the future, come what
might, he would be on his guard, and not commit himself
by betraying his emotions.
</p>

<p>
"I must leave this place immediately," was his
thought, "before suspicion will have time to fix on me,
and trust to time and absence for security.  But first, I
must find some clue to this horrible mystery.  Oh! that
dreadful night.  Oh, that it could be forever blotted from
my memory."
</p>

<p>
Even while he spoke, an unusual bustle below met his
ear.  He heard voices speaking in quick, excited tones;
then a scream, and then the sound of many feet hurrying
to and fro.
</p>

<p>
With the one idea, the one dread thought of his guilt
being discovered, ever uppermost in his mind, he listened
in an agony of impatience for what might follow.
</p>

<p>
Still the bustle and excitement continued, and,
wrought up to a fever of anxiety, he was about to rise
and go in quest of information, when the door suddenly
opened, and Laura, pale, trembling, and horror-stricken,
stood before him.
</p>

<p>
"In the name of Heaven, what is the matter, Laura?"
he asked, in a voice hoarse with agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edgar! you have not heard the dreadful news?"
she said, trembling.
</p>

<p>
"What dreadful news?  Speak and tell me instantly,"
he said, grasping her arm, and setting his teeth hard.
</p>

<p>
"You remember that lovely little island-girl, Christie?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; what of her?" he said, turning frightfully pale.
</p>

<p>
"In the fearful storm of last night, she was most
foully murdered.  Poor, gentle little Christie!"
</p>

<p>
He knew all now, he remembered her resemblance to
his wife; that had deceived him.  She, then, had been
his victim.  In spite of all his resolve to be calm, he was
forced to grasp a chair to steady himself.  But in her
sorrow and horror, his wife did not perceive his increasing
agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Dear beautiful Christie! so fair, so young, so gentle,
to meet so terrible a fate.  Oh, Edgar, what a demon her
assassin must have been, worse than a demon, for even a
demon would not have committed such a deed.  Poor
little child! what an awful doom was hers."
</p>

<p>
He had recovered his outward calmness by this time,
and, steadying his trembling voice, he asked:
</p>

<p>
"Who could have done the deed?"
</p>

<p>
"No one knows.  Mrs. Tom and Sibyl Campbell have
only just arrived, and all they can tell about it is, that,
owing to some unknown cause, she either left or was
borne from the house during the night, and part of her
clothing was found this morning covered with blood.
The body could not be found, and it is supposed it was
carried away by the waves.  Oh, it is horrible!  What
crime would not men be guilty of, since they could even
murder that gentle girl.  The proper authorities are
about to be apprised of the fact, and the island is to be
searched to see if any clew to the discovery of the
murderer can be found."
</p>

<p>
"What is supposed to be the cause of the murder?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there is no cause assigned.  Everything is
wrapped in the deepest mystery; but I have an idea of
my own.  You know poor Christie was exceedingly
beautiful, and some one may have become enamored of her
and attempted to carry her off, thinking the night and
storm favorable to his purpose.  Most probably she
resisted; and, failing in his purpose, in a fit of passion he
may have slain her, and fled to escape the consequences
of the act."
</p>

<p>
"Most probably that is it," said Courtney, wishing
fervently that every one else would adopt his
opinion.
</p>

<p>
"But, oh, it is terrible&mdash;terrible!" exclaimed Laura.
"Poor little Christie!  And her aunt is almost deranged.
Oh, to think we should all have been safe here, thinking
only of our own petty troubles, while she was lying,
wounded and dying, exposed to the fury of the winds
and waves!  I do not know how it is, but there is a
feeling of remorse in my heart, as if I were in some way
accountable for this crime."
</p>

<p>
"You, Laura!  What nonsense!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know; but <i>still</i> it is there."
</p>

<p>
"An over-excited brain, that is all.  Who is down
stairs now?"
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl Campbell and Mrs. Brantwell.  Mrs. Tom and
Mr. Brantwell have gone to the magistrate's."
</p>

<p>
"I think you said Sibyl Campbell came with Mrs. Tom.
Was she on the island last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she went there about dark."
</p>

<p>
"What! in all that storm?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I believe so."
</p>

<p>
"What could have taken her there?" asked Courtney,
who scarcely knew what his own object was in asking
these questions, except it was to keep his mind from
dwelling on what he had done.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know.  Oh, yes! now I recollect; it was a
note brought her by her brother; and, strangely enough,
from Christie herself.  She seemed very much agitated
upon receiving it, and insisted on going immediately to
the isle, in spite of the storm."
</p>

<p>
Courtney gave a sudden start; a strange light leaped
into his eyes; his white face flushed, and then became
paler than before, as he said:
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what this note contained?"
</p>

<p>
"No, how should I?"
</p>

<p>
"Did Miss Campbell meet Christie the night of the
murder?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I heard her telling Mrs. Brantwell that the
storm came on so violently that she was scarcely able to
reach the lodge, much less the cottage."
</p>

<p>
"Are you aware whether those two girls were on
good terms?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what a question!  What do you mean, Edgar?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, nothing; answer my question."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I really do not know; but I fancy not."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course, I may be mistaken, but I think
Sibyl was jealous of poor Christie at one time.  Willard
Drummond certainly paid her a great deal more attention
than he should have done, considering he was betrothed
to Sibyl.  But, then, he was always fickle."
</p>

<p>
"And Sibyl was jealous?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am quite sure she was."
</p>

<p>
"And, consequently, this island-girl's enemy?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I cannot say as to that.  What on earth <i>do</i> you
mean, Edgar?"
</p>

<p>
"Who first discovered the murder?"
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! <i>she did!</i>  And I presume she immediately went
and told Mrs. Tom?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I heard her telling Mrs. Brantwell that she
found it out somehow&mdash;-I forget how&mdash;somewhere about
midnight; but she did not inform Mrs. Tom till morning."
</p>

<p>
"Why was that?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Really, Mr. Courtney, if I were on
trial as a witness, you could not cross-examine me more
strictly," said Mrs. Courtney, beginning to lose patience.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to know all the particulars, Laura.  Did you
hear anything else?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;yes.  I heard Mrs. Tom telling Mr. Brantwell,
that about the time they suppose the deed was committed,
Carl Henley saw a woman flying through the island; but
<i>that</i> no one credits."
</p>

<p>
"A <i>woman</i>, did you say?"
</p>

<p>
And the strange light in Courtney's eyes grew almost
insufferable.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but I suppose he dreamt it, or wished to add to
his own importance by a made up story."
</p>

<p>
"I do not think so," said Courtney, who had good
reasons for the belief.  "Perhaps this tangled web may
yet be unraveled."
</p>

<p>
"Edgar, in the name of all the saints! what do you
mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  I mean nothing&mdash;never mind now.  Perhaps
my suspicions are premature."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, Edgar! you surely do not suspect&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hush!</i>" he said, in a hoarse whisper; "I suspect no
one.  Be silent concerning what has passed.  Leave me
now, I wish to lie down.  When those people return
from searching the island, come and let me know the
result.  I do not wish to be disturbed before."
</p>

<p>
Wondering what possible meaning could be couched
beneath his mysterious words, Mrs. Courtney left the
room.
</p>

<p>
Edgar Courtney sat down, and with knitted brows
and compressed lips fell into deep thought.  Now and
then his white face would blanch to a more ghastly hue
still, and his muscles would twitch convulsively; and,
again, an expression of demoniacal joy and triumph
would light up his countenance, to be clouded a moment
after, by doubt and fear, while his customary midnight
scowl grew darker and darker.  At last, a look of desperate
resolution usurped every other expression, and he hissed
through his clenched teeth:
</p>

<p>
"I will do it!  I will do it!  <i>Anything</i>, even this, sooner
than the fate that may be mine.  It can easily be proved.
A slighter chain of circumstantial evidence has been
found, before now, strong enough to hang&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused suddenly, and cast a terrified glance
around, as if fearful the very walls might hear his
diabolical plot.  Or, perhaps, the word suggested what might
one day be his own destiny.
</p>

<p>
He arose and paced excitedly up and down the room,
so deeply absorbed in thought, that he heeded not the
flight of time, until the sudden opening of the door, and
the entrance of his wife startled him from his reverie.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, seating himself, and trying to hide
his anxiety under a show of composure.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they have searched every corner of the island so
carefully, that if a pin had been lost, it must have been
found; but it is all in vain.  They cannot obtain the
slightest clew to the discovery of the murderer or his victim.
All that has been found is a knife, deeply stained with
blood, which places the fact that she has been murdered,
beyond the possibility of a doubt.  The murderer, in his
flight, probably dropped it unawares," said Laura.
</p>

<p>
Courtney started in alarm at the news; but a moment's
reflection convinced him, that&mdash;as the weapon
bore neither name nor initials, and had never been seen
with him&mdash;there was nothing to be feared from the discovery.
</p>

<p>
"And what do they mean to do now?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know&mdash;give up the search, I suppose, since
it seems utterly useless to continue it.  Poor, ill-fated
little Christie!"
</p>

<p>
"Has Mrs. Tom returned to the island?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And Miss Campbell?"
</p>

<p>
"She is here, where she intends remaining."
</p>

<p>
"How does she bear this news?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she seems terribly excited, I must say; and I do
not wonder at it.  She insisted on going with them to the
island, and aiding in the search; and has been walking
up and down the room, like one half crazy, since their
return."
</p>

<p>
"Very singular agitation to be produced by the death
of a girl she did not like, isn't it?" said Courtney, in a
peculiar tone.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Edgar! who could help being agitated at so
dreadful a deed.  Every one is horror-stricken."
</p>

<p>
"You are not thus agitated, Laura!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I feel it none the less deeply on that account;
but Miss Campbell and I are different; and, besides, she
has known her much longer than I have.  But it is almost
dark, Edgar; and you have had no dinner.  Are you
sufficiently recovered to come down to tea?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not; I do not care for any.  I will go to bed."
</p>

<p>
"Let me bring you up some tea and toast first," said
Laura.  "You have eaten nothing all day."
</p>

<p>
She left the room, and soon reappeared with the tea-tray.
And Courtney, to satisfy his wife&mdash;having partaken
of a light supper&mdash;retired to bed, wearied after the
excitement of the day.
</p>

<p>
He closed his eyes, but not in sleep.  Hour after hour
passed on, while he lay tossing restlessly, striving to
banish from his mind the tragedy of the previous night.
All in vain! sleep would not come at his call.  Again he
beheld the lifeless form of the murdered girl lying before
him, with the rain and wind beating pitilessly on her
cold, white face, while the life-blood ebbed slowly from
the wound his hand had inflicted.  He closed his eyes
with a shudder, and pressed his hands over them; but
he saw her before him still.  How the scorpion sting of
conscience lashed him now in the deep silence of the
solemn night!
</p>

<p>
At length he fell into an uneasy slumber, but only to
re-enact, in feverish dreams, the vision of his waking
hours.  Still before him was that body on the beach;
but now, as he gazed, the deep blue eyes seemed to open
and fix themselves, with a look of unutterable reproach,
on his face.  Slowly the rigid form seemed to rise and
approach him.  Nearer and nearer it came, with its
glassy, stony eyes staring upon him steadily, until it
stood by his bedside.  His tongue clove to the roof of
his mouth; cold drops of perspiration stood on his brow;
he would have cried out, but his throat seemed parched.
With one spectral hand it pointed to the gash in its side;
and laid the other, icy-cold, on his brow.  With a shriek
of terror, he sprang from the bed, and stood trembling in
every limb on the floor.
</p>

<p>
He looked around in an agony of fear and horror, but
he was alone; and with teeth chattering and head reeling,
he sank into a seat, and covered his face with his hands,
exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was she! it was she!  Am I never to be rid of
this ghostly presence?  Is she to rise from her ocean
grave thus, every night, to drive me mad?"
</p>

<p>
The great old clock in the hall chimed twelve.  He
shuddered at the sound; and hearing footsteps ascending
the stairs, knew that the family were retiring.  Casting
himself once more on the bed, he strove to compose himself,
and while away, in fitful slumber, the tedious hours,
till morning should dawn.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br><br>
THE WIDOWED BRIDEGROOM.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "One fatal remembrance, one sorrow which throws<br>
  Its bleak shade alike o'er our joys and our woes,<br>
  To which life nothing darker or brighter can bring,<br>
  For which joy has no balm, and affliction no sting."&mdash;MOORE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And where, meantime, was he, whose headstrong
passions had brought about this catastrophe?
Where was Willard Drummond?
</p>

<p>
In his far-off Virginia home, he had seen the last
remains of his only surviving parent laid in the grave,
and found himself the sole possessor of an almost princely
fortune.  And now, in deepest mourning, and with a
brow on which rested still the sad shadow of that newly
closed grave, he turned his face, once more toward the
house of Sibyl Campbell.
</p>

<p>
A complete change&mdash;a total revulsion of feeling had
taken place within him during the last few days.  The
awful presence of death had hushed the clamorous voices
of passion and ambition, and awoke within him the deepest
feelings of remorse for the unmanly part he had
acted.
</p>

<p>
All his sophistries and specious reasonings were swept
away by that dying-bed; and he felt, in its fullest force,
how base and unworthy had been his conduct.  He felt
it was his imperative duty, in spite of love and wounded
honor, to renounce Sibyl Campbell forever; and, let the
consequences be what they might, to tell her all.  It
would be a bitter humiliation to him, it would bring
life-long sorrow to her, but there was no alternative.  He
shrank from the thought of the terrible outburst of passion
his confession would be received with; but better
this than the shame and disgrace of wedding the husband
of another.
</p>

<p>
Christie was his wife&mdash;his patient, loving little wife&mdash;and,
as such, must be acknowledged before the world;
and with the resolution of following the promptings of
his better nature, despite all obstacles, he reached
Westport, one lowering autumn day, and, weary and
travel-stained, entered the "Westbrook House."
</p>

<p>
The first person on whom his eyes rested, as he went
in, was Captain Guy Campbell, sitting at a table sipping
his coffee and glancing over the morning paper.
</p>

<p>
The noise of his entrance made Captain Guy look up;
and, starting to his feet, he caught his hand and shook
it heartily, while he exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Drummond, my old friend! delighted to have you
here with us again.  Here, sit down.  Have you breakfasted?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I have only just arrived.  How are all my
friends&mdash;your sister and the Brantwells?" said Willard,
taking the proffered seat.
</p>

<p>
"All well; though Sibyl has been worrying herself to
a skeleton about that sad affair on the island.  You have
heard of it, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No; what sad affair?" said Willard, with a start.
</p>

<p>
"Why, the death of little Christie, to be sure!  It is
very singular you have not heard of it.  The papers are
all full of it; but&mdash;good heavens! my dear fellow&mdash;what
is the matter? are you ill?" said Captain Campbell,
rising in alarm.
</p>

<p>
Reeling, as though he had received a spear-thrust
through his heart, Willard Drummond sprang to his feet,
and with a face deadly white, grasped his friend by the
arm, and said, in a choking voice:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Dead</i>, did you say?  Christie dead?  How? when? where?
Of what did she die?"
</p>

<p>
"Really, Drummond, this agitation is most unaccountable,"
said Captain Campbell, slowly, and in extreme
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Dead! dead!" said Drummond, unheeding his words.
"Great Heaven!&mdash;speak and tell me&mdash;how was it? when
was it?  Where did she die?"
</p>

<p>
"On the island.  This is most extraordinary," replied
Captain Campbell, looking at the pale, agitated face
before him, in still increasing surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Captain Campbell!" exclaimed Willard, in bitter
sorrow, "if you call yourself my friend, do not keep
me in suspense now&mdash;tell me all.  How did she die?"
</p>

<p>
"It is very extraordinary, all this!" said the astonished
young captain, who was quite unprepared for such
an outburst of feeling from the usually gay, nonchalant
Willard Drummond.  "Then you have not heard she
was&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"Murdered!" said Captain Campbell.
</p>

<p>
"Murdered!  Oh, Heaven!"
</p>

<p>
And with a deep groan that seemed tearing its way up
through his anguished heart.  Willard sank into his chair
and buried his face in his hands.
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell looked at him with the most
unbounded amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Well, upon my soul!" he broke out at length, "if
this doesn't surpass anything I ever dreamed of!  I can
understand feeling sorry and horrified at so atrocious a
deed&mdash;I felt all that myself; but to take on in this way,
is something beyond me, I must confess.  Waiter, more
coffee."
</p>

<p>
"Campbell, tell me all," said Willard, springing up
and fiercely dashing back his long, black hair.  "Who
could have committed so base, so atrocious a deed?  Oh! can
there exist a being on earth, capable of committing
so infernal a crime?  Who is it?&mdash;speak and tell me; and
may Heaven's heaviest curses rest upon him, now and for
all eternity!  Who had the heart to hurt one hair of her
gentle head?"
</p>

<p>
"Drummond, my dear fellow, what means all this violent
agitation?  What was little Christie to you?"
</p>

<p>
The keen, searching look, the meaning tone, and
probing question, brought him from his fierce outburst of
remorse and anguish to a sense of the presence in which
he stood.  This was not the time or place for the
revelation; nor was it to Captain Guy Campbell, that
revelation was destined to be made.  Controlling his agony of
bitter sorrow, and still more bitter remorse, and feeling
the necessity of calmly hearing all, by a tremendous
effort, he subdued his fiercely excited feelings, and
dropped in his seat, and said, while he shaded his face
with his hands:
</p>

<p>
"To me&mdash;to me?  Nothing; yet I felt toward her
almost as if she were my sister.  When last I left her she
was full of life, and youth, and vigor; and now, now to
hear so suddenly that she is dead&mdash;and murdered!  She&mdash;sweet,
fair, and gentle as an angel, to meet such a fate!
Oh, Campbell! is it not enough to drive one mad to think
of it?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a sad thing, I must confess," said Captain
Campbell, who, being the most unsuspicious of human
beings, received this explanation as perfectly satisfactory;
"and no one but a demon in human form could have
perpetrated the deed!"
</p>

<p>
"Who is the murderer?" said Drummond, in a deep,
hollow voice.
</p>

<p>
"That cannot be discovered.  The island, and every
place else, I believe, has been searched; but no clew to
his hiding-place can be found.  Regards have been
offered, the police put on the track, but all in vain."
</p>

<p>
"When was the diabolical crime committed?"
</p>

<p>
"The very night you left N&mdash;&mdash;.  You remember the
terrific storm of that night!  Somewhere about midnight,
it is supposed, poor Christie was assassinated.  The deed
was committed somewhere near the shore; and as the
tide was very high, the body, if left on the rocks, must
have been swept away.  What could have brought Christie
from the house at such an hour, and in such a storm,
unless she had been forcibly carried out, is a mystery still
unsolved."
</p>

<p>
In spite of all his efforts, another anguished groan
broke from the tortured heart of Willard Drummond.
The thought of his note appointing that fatal meeting!
Oh, too well he knew what had brought her there; and a
pang, keener than death, pierced his soul as he thought
of that slight, delicate girl plunging through all that
howling tempest to meet him!
</p>

<p>
"Who was on the island at the time?" he asked, after
a pause.
</p>

<p>
"No one but Mrs. Tom and Carl and one or two
negroes; and&mdash;yes, now I think of it, Sibyl was there too."
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl?" said Willard, with a start.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she went over shortly after you went away.
Poor Christie, it seems, wanted her for something, and
sent her a note.  What it contained I cannot say; but it
seemed to agitate Sibyl as I have seldom seen her agitated
before; and the result of it was that she insisted,
despite the gathering storm, on going to the island that
night."
</p>

<p>
What was the thought that made Willard Drummond
turn so ghastly at that moment?
</p>

<p>
Had Christie, in that note, revealed their marriage?
and had Sibyl, in a fit of passion&mdash;he shrank in horror,
in loathing of himself at the terrible thought that the
arch-fiend suggested at that moment.  Wild, vindictive,
passionate, frenzied in her rage, he knew her to be; but,
oh! never, never could even her terrific passion carry her
so far away as to raise her hand against that gentle child's
life.  But who could have done it?  Christie, the unknown
island-girl, had not an enemy in the world except Sibyl;
and she, in violent agitation, had braved storm, and
danger, and death to reach the island that night.  Oh,
horrible thought!  With his brain reeling with conflicting
emotions, he felt for the moment as if his very reason was
leaving him.
</p>

<p>
Captain Campbell, sitting placidly before him, sipping
his coffee, saw nothing of what was passing in
Drummond's thoughts; and setting his unexpected emotion
down, partially, to the morbid state of his mind since his
father's death, and the want of rest, arose and said:
</p>

<p>
"My dear Drummond, you must be tired and worn
out with your journey.  You had better retire at once.  I
will call here this afternoon again.  When do you intend
visiting N&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Any time, to-day, to-morrow, immediately," answered
Drummond, incoherently, scarcely conscious of what he
said.
</p>

<p>
"I am going there to-morrow.  What say you to going
then?" said his companion, with a stare of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be at your service," said Drummond, striving
to rally himself.  "What with fatigue and all, I am
rather bewildered as yet; but I trust by that time to be
far enough recruited to pay my <i>devoirs</i> to the ladies at the
parsonage."
</p>

<p>
"Very strange, I must say!" mused Captain Campbell,
as he ran down the steps and entered the crowded
street.  "Very strange, indeed, that the news of little
Christie's death should so affect him.  I had some notion
once that Sibyl was a little jealous of Christie; and, faith,
I begin to think she may have had some cause for it.
But, perhaps, I wrong Drummond after all.  He is not
very excitable usually, I know; but his mind being
unusually troubled, Christie's dreadful death may have
given him a shock.  He dare not trifle with Sibyl; if he
does, he will feel the weight of a Campbell's vengeance!"
</p>

<p>
Willard meantime had secured a private room, and
was pacing up and down, and striving to collect his
thoughts.  The first shock was over&mdash;the first thrill of
horror at the news was past; and though sorrow for her
fate, and bitter remorse for what he himself had done
still remained, he could not suppress something very like
a feeling of relief.
</p>

<p>
Alas for all his good resolutions!  Gone were they
now, as the fading sunlight flies before the approach of
night; and his love, his hopes, his desires are in the
ascendant again.  Perhaps he was not altogether to
blame for the fickleness of his nature.  Perhaps most of
it might be owing to his education, to those with whom he
had mingled, and the world for which alone he had ever
lived.
</p>

<p>
He thought of Sibyl.  That momentary suspicion was
quiet, and he hated himself for having indulged it an
instant.  No; terrific as he knew her to be, when her
deep passion was roused, he felt that not on Christie&mdash;guileless,
inoffensive Christie&mdash;would fall her vengeance,
but on him, who rightly deserved it.  His glorious,
high-spirited Sibyl, the descendant of a daring, chivalrous
race, would not stoop to slay a weak, unprotected girl
like this.  There was no obstacle now to prevent his
marriage; she might lawfully become his wife, when his
period of mourning was past.  There was a thrill of
secret joy in his heart at the thought; but the sad,
reproachful face of Christie rose like a vision before him,
and with a shudder he sat down, while remorse again
tugged at his heart-strings.
</p>

<p>
So passed the morning; and when Captain Campbell
entered his room again, he found him, though outwardly
calm and composed, pale, with many conflicting
emotions.
</p>

<p>
Before he left, it was arranged that they should set
out together the following day for N&mdash;&mdash;.
</p>

<p>
And the next morning the two young men started for
the residence of the Brantwells.
</p>

<p>
They reached it late the same afternoon, and were
warmly welcomed by good Mrs. Brantwell.  Sibyl, thinner
and paler than Willard had ever beheld her, flushed
with pleasure as he embraced her, and took a seat by her
side.
</p>

<p>
He looked earnestly in her face; but he read nothing
there save deep, subdued sadness; no guilt lingered on
that broad, queenly brow, or in those clear, bright eyes.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of course, the conversation first turned
on Christie, and her melancholy fate.
</p>

<p>
"You have heard it, no doubt, Mr. Drummond," said
Mrs. Brant well.
</p>

<p>
"From my friend Captain Campbell&mdash;yes, madam,"
he answered, gravely, but calmly.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl's keen eyes were bent with ill-concealed anxiety
upon him, and she drew a deep breath of relief as she
noted his quiet gravity, as if a heavy load had been lifted
off her breast.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Mrs. Tom!" sighed the minister's wife, "she is
indeed to be pitied.  I urged her to quit that lonesome
island, and we would provide for her somewhere here,
but she refused; and says that the only comfort she has
now is in watching the waves under which her darling
Christie is buried."
</p>

<p>
A faint shudder passed over Drummond's frame, in
spite of himself, at her words.
</p>

<p>
"By the way, Mr. Brantwell," said Captain Campbell,
"where are the Courtneys?  They were speaking of
going away somewhere when last I was here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they have gone home.  Mr. Courtney was in
very poor health; and even Mrs. Courtney, poor
thing! seemed to have lost most of her high spirits, and was
glad to be on the wing again," replied Mrs. Brantwell.
</p>

<p>
During this short dialogue, Sibyl and Willard were
conversing together in low tones.
</p>

<p>
"And so your resolution is really to go abroad?" said
Sibyl, lifting her dark eyes anxiously to his face.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;but for some months only; and the project
gives me pleasure in the thought alone that, in so doing,
I will not be separated from you."
</p>

<p>
"No! and how?" she said, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Then you are not aware that your brother, having
completed all his business, and refitted his vessel, is
about to take you with him again to England?"
</p>

<p>
"I was really quite ignorant of that fact."
</p>

<p>
"Well, so it is.  We all start together in three weeks'
time, I believe."
</p>

<p>
A flush of pleased surprise passed over Sibyl's pale
face.
</p>

<p>
"Then, in that case, I shall have an opportunity of
accomplishing my long-cherished wish of visiting Italy.
I have long and ardently desired to see that beautiful
land."
</p>

<p>
"And after that, fairest Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall return home."
</p>

<p>
"And what then, beautiful one?"
</p>

<p>
"'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,'" quoted
Sibyl, with a smile.  "Who knows what the future may
bring forth?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me tell you, beautiful Sibyl," said Drummond,
in the low, musical tones that had so often thrilled to her
inmost heart.  "After that may I claim this little hand as
mine?  Say, fairest Sibyl, may I look forward to our
return to claim my bride?"
</p>

<p>
She lifted her eyes to the handsome face bending over
her, so full of perfect love and devotion now; and, like
the frank glorious creature she was, she laid her hand in
his, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Sibyl, my dear," broke in the voice of Mrs. Brantwell
at this interesting juncture, in tones of deepest
dismay, "do you know what Guy says?  All three of you
are to start off on a wild-goose chase to Europe, instead
of settling down and behaving yourselves, as sensible
Christians should.  It's really quite abominable, and I,
for one, have set my face against it; and I am sure, Sibyl,
you'd agree with me."
</p>

<p>
"Really, my dear Mrs. Brantwell," said Sibyl, smiling,
"I am afraid I cannot.  I wish to go quite as much
as Guy."
</p>

<p>
"You do?" exclaimed the minister's wife.  "Well,
upon my word, if this is not too provoking!  It all comes
of having a taste for rambling, and being male and female
sailors, the whole of you!  I always thought sailors were
vagabonds on the face of the earth, without any settled
place of abode, and I'm sure of it now.  You don't expect
to be able to go in three weeks, I should hope?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course, I do.  What's to hinder?" said Sibyl.
"I am not a fine lady, you know, and don't require two
or three dozen trunks packed before I start.  So, Captain
Campbell, though you did not do me the honor of
consulting me before all your arrangements were made,
I shall reserve my wounded pride and indignation to
another season, and be ready to go with you at a moment's
warning."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Brantwell expostulated in vain.  Sibyl would go;
but promised faithfully to return within nine months, at
farthest.
</p>

<p>
And so, three weeks later, our trio stood on the deck
of the Evening Star, "outward bound."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br><br>
THE THUNDERBOLT FALLS.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "They spake not a word,<br>
  But, like dumb statues, or breathless stores,<br>
  Stared at each other, and looked deadly pale."&mdash;SHAKESPEARE<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is not my intention to chronicle the events of that
foreign tour.  Suffice it to say, it came to an end, at
last; and, Captain Guy Campbell, Willard Drummond,
and his betrothed stood once more upon the shore
of their native land.
</p>

<p>
There was a joyful meeting that day in the parsonage.
Good Mrs. Brantwell, as she again clasped her favorite,
Sibyl, in her arms, shed tears of joy.
</p>

<p>
Those twelve months of absence had greatly improved
Sibyl.  The rich bloom of perfect health again mantled
her cheeks; her magnificent eyes, brilliant with hope and
happiness, once more outshone her diamonds.  Through
all the foreign cities through which she had traveled,
her dazzling beauty had created the deepest sensation.
Known to be an heiress, beauty, and belle, countless
hearts had been laid at her feet; but Sibyl never for an
instant, in thought or act, was unfaithful to that first,
strong, undying love that was part of her very nature.
</p>

<p>
And now the period of Willard Drummond's mourning
was passed, and they had returned home, to be united
at last.
</p>

<p>
How ardently and truly he loved Sibyl now&mdash;far better
than he had every one before.  How proudly he had
exulted in the knowledge that this peerless, queenly girl,
at whose feet coronets had been laid, and rejected, was
his&mdash;his alone; would soon be his bride&mdash;his wife.  How
his heart had swelled with triumph when he beheld the
envious looks and jealous glances bestowed upon him,
by more than one titled nobleman of other lands.  He
longed, as the blind long for sight, for the time when this
glorious, radiant Sibyl would be his own, undisputed
wife, beyond earthly power to separate them.  Until that
time came, he must live in uncertainty, not knowing
whether this prize might not yet slip through his fingers.
</p>

<p>
That time, so ardently looked forward to, was at hand
now.  Preparations for the wedding were already
commenced on a scale of magnificence that was destined to
electrify the community far and near, and which the
princely fortunes of the bride and bridegroom could
alone justify.
</p>

<p>
The day was appointed, and invitations were sent out
to all the <i>elite</i> within fifty miles, to attend the ball, with
which it was then customary to conclude a wedding.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl, with her usual willfulness, would not be married
in the house in the evening; it did not seem right,
she said.  She would be married in the church, in the
morning; and, as this was of little consequence to the
rest, her wish was immediately acceded to.
</p>

<p>
On rosy wings sped the time, until the auspicious
morning dawned.  Brightly and cloudlessly arose the
sun, ushering in a day as glorious as ever came out of the
heavens.  How little did any one dream how darkly and
fatally that day was destined to end?
</p>

<p>
It was arranged that the day following the ceremony
the bridal pair should again take their departure for a
wedding tour, and everything was prepared accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Good Mrs. Brantwell, as mistress of the ceremonies,
had a very busy time of it for the preceding two weeks.
Milliners and dressmakers from the city filled the upper
rooms, and cooks and confectioners the lower regions.
To her lot it fell to purchase dresses, laces, jewels, etc.,
for the use of the bride&mdash;who, with her characteristic
indifference to all such things, would, if left to herself,
have committed the unpardonable sin of being married in
her simple white robe of India muslin, instead of her
splendid silver brocade, frosted with seed-pearls, which
the sumptuous taste of that worthy lady had selected.
</p>

<p>
Among the many guests invited to the "wedding-feast"
we may mention our old friend, Mrs. Tom.  Poor
little Mrs. Tom!  Since the loss of little Christie she had
never been the same bright, brisk, breezy, chirruping
body she had been before, and though still active and
bustling as ever, her cheery laugh was far less seldom
heard.  Mr. Carl Henley, too, was to be present; and
made his appearance on the eventful morning in a long
blue "swaller-tail," brilliant with brass buttons, his boots
and hair shining with lard, and his round, full-moon face
wearing a look of sublime beatification, serene in the
blissful consciousness of a new suit of clothes and a pair
of white gloves, every greasy hair in his head breathing
"peace on earth, good will to man.'
</p>

<p>
Two young girls from Westport were to be bride-maids,
and a young Englishman, whom they had met
abroad, together with a cousin of Mr. Drummond's were
to be groomsmen.  Captain Campbell, as her nearest
relative, was to give the bride away.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning, the first carriages began to
arrive, and soon the lower hall and drawing-room were
crowded with guests, waiting to accompany the bridal
party to church.
</p>

<p>
In her room, before a full-length mirror, Sibyl Campbell,
so soon to be Sibyl Drummond, stood, whiles half a
dozen girls, headed by Mrs. Brantwell, arrayed her for
bridal.
</p>

<p>
Magnificently beautiful she looked as she stood there,
her rich robe of sheeny silk floating about her regal form,
her queenly brow clasped by a tiara of finest diamonds,
her gauzy veil of costliest lace enveloping her like a
cloud of mist&mdash;her dark cheeks flushed with excitement,
her magnificent eyes outflashing the jewels she wore.
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful! glorious! radiant!" broke from the lips
of her attendants, as they stepped back to survey the
effect.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, beautiful indeed!" mentally exclaimed
Mrs. Brantwell, "beautiful beyond compare looks my peerless
Sibyl in her bridal robes."
</p>

<p>
And just then the door was thrown impetuously open,
and one of the bride-maids, a vivacious little lady, with
twinkling brown eyes, burst in, exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
"Girls! girls! aren't you ready yet.  Oh, my goodness!
Sibyl, how splendid you look.  But do hurry!
That happiest of mortal men, Mr. Willard Drummond, is
waiting, with all the rest of the folks&mdash;a hundred and
fifty if there's one&mdash;down stairs.  Hurry!"
</p>

<p>
Thus abjured, like a flock of startled birds, the
bower-maidens fled to arrange their own toilet, and Sibyl was
alone with Mrs. Brantwell.
</p>

<p>
"My own precious Sibyl! and am I to lose you at
last?" said Mrs. Brantwell, clasping her in her arms, and
gazing upon her sparkling face, with eyes of yearning
fondness.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Mrs. Brantwell, my second mother, come what
may, let the future bring what it will, you will ever hold
the second place in my heart," said Sibyl, dropping her
head on the shoulder of her friend.
</p>

<p>
"And you are happy, <i>perfectly</i> happy, my own darling?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, perfectly happy, too happy for words to say.
Oh, Mrs. Brantwell, my only fear is that such intense joy
is too blissful to last."
</p>

<p>
"And you have perfect trust, perfect faith in him who
is so soon to be your husband?  Does no doubt still
linger amid all this love?"
</p>

<p>
"None, none! not the slightest, not the faintest.  Oh!
I wronged him by ever doubting his truth.  I could
stake my hopes of heaven on his fidelity now," exclaimed
Sibyl, with some of her old fierce impetuosity.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven for that!" said Mrs. Brantwell, with
a sigh of relief.  "Oh!  Sibyl, dearest, eradicate forever
from your heart this fatal dream of jealousy; to doubt
one we love is deepest misery."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I know it; I know it," said Sibyl, with a
shudder, as she recalled the stormy past.
</p>

<p>
And just then the tripping of light feet approaching
the door was heard.
</p>

<p>
"It is the girls coming back to take you down stairs,"
said Mrs. Brantwell.  "And now, my own, my dearest
girl, may Heaven bless you, and grant you all happiness."
</p>

<p>
"Amen!" solemnly, almost sadly, said Sibyl, as she
returned her embrace, and stood waiting the entrance of
her bride-maids.
</p>

<p>
They burst in in a bevy, fluttering round the bride
like bright-winged birds, as they shook out their
glittering plumage with little, white, jeweled hands, and
announced that the bridegroom and his friends were
waiting for them in the hall below.
</p>

<p>
And together the bride and her friends descended the
stairs, followed by Mrs. Brantwell, and entered the hall,
crowded with guests.
</p>

<p>
A low murmur of admiration passed through the
throng at sight of the radiant bride.  And Willard
Drummond, handsome, suave, and stately, stepped
forward and drew her hand within his arm, and led her to
the carriage that was to convey them to the church.
</p>

<p>
The others followed; and as that sacred edifice was
situated but a few yards from the house, they reached it
in a short time.
</p>

<p>
The church, too, was crowded, mostly by strangers,
some from places far distant, drawn together by the
rumors of the bride's wondrous beauty.  So crowded
was it that half the bridal party could not find seats,
but were obliged to stand.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brantwell, in full canonicals, stood, book in hand,
awaiting their approach.
</p>

<p>
They advanced under the admiring eyes of the crowd,
and stood before him.
</p>

<p>
And at that very instant, like an inspiration, flashed
across the eyes of Willard Drummond the remembrance
of the strange vision he had seen years before.  Here it
was, all there before him.  The crowded church, the
bridal party, the clergyman and bride wearing exactly
the faces of those he had beheld then.
</p>

<p>
A thrill of vague terror, he knew not why, shot
through his heart.  He thought of Christie&mdash;lost,
murdered Christie&mdash;and of that other bridal, which took
place at night, in secrecy.  But then, lifting his eyes,
they fell on the gloriously beautiful face of her who
stood before him, and all was forgotten once more but
his bride.
</p>

<p>
The ceremony began, amid a breathless silence, as the
vast concourse listened, with the eagerness they always
do on such occasions.  The questions were put and
answered in the usual manner, when a slight tumult at
the door broke for the first time the impressive silence.
</p>

<p>
The clergyman had almost concluded the ceremony,
and the bridegroom was just putting the nuptial ring on
the finger of the bride, with the words: "With this ring
I do thee wed; with all my worldly goods I thee endow,
in the name of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hold!</i>  I forbid the marriage!" cried a deep, stern
voice, that rang through the church.
</p>

<p>
Every head was turned, every eye was riveted on the
speaker, a tall, determined-looking man.
</p>

<p>
White with vague apprehensions, the bride and bridegroom
turned round, while the bride-maids shrieked
outright at the interruption.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brantwell stood, like one thunderstruck, book in
hand.
</p>

<p>
And the stranger, the cause of all this commotion,
walked steadily up the aisle and stood before them.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, sir?" was the amazed and angry question
from the lips of Captain Campbell, who was the first
to recover from his shock of astonishment at this
astounding interruption.
</p>

<p>
"Sheriff Lawless, sir; and it is my painful duty to
prevent this marriage."
</p>

<p>
"By what right?" fiercely demanded the young man,
with kindling eyes.
</p>

<p>
"By a right all-sufficient for the purpose, young man."
calmly answered the sheriff.  "I have a warrant here for
the arrest of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Whom?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl Campbell, the bride!"
</p>

<p>
"Great Heaven! on what charge?  You are mad, man."
</p>

<p>
"On the charge of having, fifteen months ago,
assassinated Christina Tomlinson, on Campbell's Isle!"
</p>

<p>
A wild, terrific shriek, so full of passionate grief that
it thrilled through every heart, rang through the house.
It was the voice of Mrs. Tom.

CHAPTER XXIX.
<br><br>
THE DEVOTION OF LOVE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "I know not, I ask not,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If guilt's in thy heart;<br>
  I but know that I love thee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever thou art."&mdash;MOORE<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It would be impossible to depict or describe the
consternation that reigned now within the church.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom, in a deadly swoon, was borne from the
sacred edifice.
</p>

<p>
The book had dropped from the hand of the clergyman,
and dumb with amazement and incredulity, he stood
staring at the official.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Brantwell, pale, and almost fainting at so monstrous
a charge, made at such a time, and in such a place,
hid her shuddering face in her trembling hands.
</p>

<p>
The bride-maids, like a flock of frightened birds, had
clustered together, gazing around with vague,
terror-stricken eyes.
</p>

<p>
And the people, after the first shock of horror and
amazement, became mute as the grave, listening, with
breathless interest, for the <i>denouement</i> of this astounding
interruption, with the eager, morbid curiosity a crowd
will always listen to anything of the sort.
</p>

<p>
But the group around the altar; <i>they</i> were the focus
of all eyes.  Captain Guy Campbell, his dark eye blazing,
his brow corrugated, his lips white with passion, stood
gazing on the sheriff, as if he would spring upon him and
rend him limb from limb on the spot, for making so
terrible a charge against a sister of his.
</p>

<p>
That gentleman stood calm, stern, and unmoved,
upheld by the consciousness that he was doing his duty,
however painful, and keeping his eyes fixed, with
something like pity, on the face of the bride.
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond, fearing she might faint or fall,
had encircled her waist with his arm; and, though his
own face was perfectly colorless with horror and
indignation, stooped and whispered:
</p>

<p>
"My bride&mdash;my wife&mdash;my dearest one, be calm!  This
monstrous accusation will be explained."
</p>

<p>
Be calm!  There was little need to tell her to be calm.
After the first involuntary shock, she stood like an
outraged empress before them, her regal form drawn up to
its full height, her noble brow expanded, her dark,
magnificent eyes blazing with insulted pride and unutterable
scorn, her full lips curled with a contempt too profound
for words, her whole face and form irradiated with the
light of insulted majesty.
</p>

<p>
There was one instant's death-like pause, broken at
last by the voice of Mr. Lawless, saying politely:
</p>

<p>
"I am very sorry that painful necessity compels me to
thus break up the festivities of this day.  This charge
against the lady may be groundless&mdash;I hope it is.  But I
have a duty to perform, however unpleasant it may be to
me, and to all of you."
</p>

<p>
"On whose charge is my sister arrested for this deed?"
said Captain Campbell, in a deep, stern voice.
</p>

<p>
"On that of Mr. Edgar Courtney, I believe," answered
the sheriff.
</p>

<p>
"Edgar Courtney!" rang from every lip, in tones in
which amazement had completely mastered every other
feeling.  Even Sibyl looked bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and in support of his deposition he has brought
to bear such a strong chain of circumstantial evidence,
that even in the face of the proof being brought against a
young lady so wealthy, high-born, and distinguished as
Miss Campbell, it was found necessary to issue a warrant
for her immediate apprehension."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven of heavens! this is maddening!  Oh! for
the thunderbolt of Heaven to blast that double-dyed
perjurer where he stands!" exclaimed Captain Campbell,
passionately.
</p>

<p>
Without heeding this indignant outburst, the sheriff
turned to Sibyl and said, courteously;
</p>

<p>
"Miss Campbell, this duty is exceedingly unpleasant
to me; but I regret to say you must go with me now!"
</p>

<p>
"Where?" said Sibyl, in a tone of such supernatural
calmness, that every one was startled.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Campbell, I am very sorry; but it is my duty
to convey you to the county jail, to await your trial."
</p>

<p>
"The county jail!" exclaimed Sibyl, losing her powerful
self-control for the first time during this trying
scene; and with a convulsive shudder hiding her face on
Willard's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
He clasped her closer to his side, as if he defied earth
and heaven to tear her from him; but still he spoke not a
word.  Was it the impossibility of the charge?  Was it
his indignation and horror? or was it this awful
confirmation of his first doubts, and the vivid recollection
the scene at the astrologer's that held him dumb.
</p>

<p>
But Captain Campbell, losing all self-control, all
remembrance of where he stood, once more passionately
and impetuously broke forth:
</p>

<p>
"To the county jail!  So help me Heaven!&mdash;never!
Never will Sibyl Campbell submit to such a degradation!
Sooner will I shoot her dead with my own hand where
she stands!  Oh, 'tis monstrous!&mdash;outrageous!&mdash;that any
one should dare to accuse a Campbell of such an infernal
deed and live!" he exclaimed, clenching his hands and
teeth in his impotent, fiery wrath.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Guy, be calm; remember where you are,"
interposed Mr. Brantwell, soothingly.  "If Mr. Lawless
wants bail to any amount, whatever you may name&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Parson Brantwell, I should like to oblige you, but
you must be aware that I cannot listen to you; unfortunately,
the charge is not a bailable one.  And I trust,"
added the sheriff, glancing half threateningly, half
pityingly at Captain Campbell, "no resistance will be offered
me in the discharge of my solemn duty; for, painful as
the announcement is, there is no help for it.  The young
lady <i>must</i> come with me."
</p>

<p>
"A bride to spend her wedding-day in a prison-cell!
Oh, saints in heaven!" shudderingly exclaimed
Mrs. Brantwell.
</p>

<p>
"I am ready," said Sibyl, lifting her pale, beautiful
face, and speaking in tones of supernatural calmness.
"I will go with you, sir, and there will be no resistance
offered.  Guy, dearest brother, be calm; this violence
will not aid me, and will lower yourself.  Mrs. Brantwell,
may I trouble you to bring me my mantle from the
carriage?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, must you go?" exclaimed Mrs. Brantwell, wringing
her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately, dear madam, there seems to be no
alternative."
</p>

<p>
"But not in that dress&mdash;not in that dress!  Sir, may
she not return to the parsonage and change her dress?"
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I am very sorry, but I cannot lose sight of
my prisoner."
</p>

<p>
A circle of white flamed round the eyes of Captain
Campbell, and he clenched his hands and groaned in his
bitter degradation.
</p>

<p>
"Then I am quite ready to go.  Mrs. Brantwell, dearest
friend, farewell for a short time only, I trust.  Guy,
brother, do not feel this so deeply; in a few days I trust
to return to you all again.  Willard"&mdash;her clear, full
voice choked for the first time as she turned to
him&mdash;"dearest Willard, I must bid you good by."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Sibyl!  Sibyl!  Oh, my wife! do you think I will
leave you thus?" he cried, passionately, as, unheeding the
many eyes upon him, he strained her to his bosom as if
he would have drawn her into his very heart beyond their
reach.  "Oh, my bride! my beautiful one! never will I
leave you&mdash;<i>never</i>!"
</p>

<p>
A radiant glance, a look, a smile, rewarded him, while
every heart thrilled at his anguished tones.
</p>

<p>
"Your own, in life or death, in shame, disgrace, and
misery&mdash;ever your own!" she said, looking up in his face
with deep, earnest, undying love.
</p>

<p>
There was not a dry eye in the church; every one was
sobbing&mdash;Mrs. Brantwell so convulsively that the sheriff,
who was really a kind-hearted man, was deeply distressed.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Campbell, will you accept my arm?" he said,
feeling the necessity of bringing this scene at once to an
end.  "My carriage is at the door to convey you to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The county jail!  Oh, Sibyl! oh, my sister!  Would
to Heaven you had died before you had seen this day!"
</p>

<p>
"Brother, brother! be calm.  Mr. Lawless, I attend
you," said Sibyl, advancing a step, as if to take the arm
he offered.
</p>

<p>
But Willard Drummond intercepted the movement,
and drew her arm within his own, saying, with a fierce,
threatening glance toward the sheriff:
</p>

<p>
"I will attend you, Sibyl; I alone have the right.
Lead on, sir"&mdash;to the sheriff&mdash;"we attend your pleasure.
No one on earth shall separate me from my bride!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Drummond, the&mdash;the ceremony was not finished
when the interruption occurred," stammered the
minister, looking deeply distressed.
</p>

<p>
But a scornful smile was Willard Drummond's sole
reply, as he clasped the arm he held closer within his
own.
</p>

<p>
"I, too, will go!" cried Captain Campbell.  "Sheriff
Lawless, your strict sense of duty will not, I trust,
prevent your allowing me to accompany my sister to the
county jail."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Campbell is quite welcome to a seat in my
carriage," said the officer of the law, with a grave bow,
and without heeding his bitter sneer.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, Mrs. Brantwell&mdash;my more than mother,
farewell!" said Sibyl, as the whole party, preceded by the
sheriff, advanced down the aisle.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Brantwell strove to reply, but her voice was
choked.  Taking her husband's arm, she followed them
out.
</p>

<p>
The whole assembly arose <i>en masse</i>, and started for the
door, casting threatening looks toward the sheriff, as
though half meditating a rescue on the spot.
</p>

<p>
A plain, dark-looking coach, with a mounted policeman
on either side, stood near the gate.
</p>

<p>
The sheriff paused when he reached it, and signified
that they were to enter.  Mr. Drummond handed Sibyl in
and took his seat beside her; Captain Campbell, with a
stern, gloomy look, followed; and then the sheriff sprang
in, closed the door, and gave the order to drive on.  Sibyl
bent from the carriage window to wave a last adieu to
Mrs. Brantwell; and the crowd standing on the church-steps
and court-yard caught a momentary glimpse of her
pale, beautiful face, with its sad, twilight smile, her dark,
proud eyes more scornful than ever in their humiliation.
That haunting face, so perfectly colorless, with its bright,
jetty ringlets, its floating, mist-like vail, its orange
blossoms&mdash;could it be the face of a murderess?
</p>

<p>
The next moment she fell back, the blinds were
closed, the driver cracked his whip, the policemen put
spurs to their horses, and the sad cavalcade moved rapidly
away.
</p>

<p>
Hushed into the silence of death, the crowd stood
breathlessly gazing after it, until the sound of the
carriage wheels had died away&mdash;the last cloud of dust raised
by the horses' feet vanished.  Then pale, and awe-struck,
they drew a deep breath and looked with tearful eyes
into each other's pale faces, wondering if it were not all
a dream.
</p>

<p>
Whispering in low, hushed tones beneath their breath,
they separated, and wended their way to their respective
homes; and in half an hour the church was as still, silent
and deserted as the tomb.
</p>

<p>
Like wild-fire spread the news; and before night it
was not only known to all the county round, but for
many a mile distant.  The whole community was electrified
by a catastrophe so unheard-of.  Children quit their
play, women their work, lovers their whispers, and laborers
their daily toil, to talk over the astounding arrest.
The wealth, the respectability, the youth, the beauty, the
sex, the well-known arrogance and pride of the race from
which the accused had sprung, all tended to heighten and
deepen the breathless interest.  And the time and place&mdash;the
occasion of occasions on which the arrest had taken
place&mdash;that, more than all, sent a thrill of horror through
every heart.  Each circumstance of the interview in the
church was exaggerated, and people listened and
swallowed everything with avidity.
</p>

<p>
In the parsonage, meantime, a cloud of the deepest
gloom had settled over its lately joyous inmates.
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Brantwell, with the three bride-maids
and Will Stafford, had immediately, upon the departure
of Sibyl, entered their carriage and driven to the
minister's house.
</p>

<p>
And the bride-maids, in great agitation, not to say
deep disappointment at losing the ball in the evening,
dressed themselves and went immediately home.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Brantwell sat weeping in a perfect abandon of
grief, in the parlor below, and would not be comforted.
Mr. Brantwell and Mr. Stafford, themselves in deep
distress, strove to console her in vain.
</p>

<p>
Poor Will Stafford! it was not without a struggle he
had seen Sibyl given up to another; but hiding the sharp,
dreary pain at his heart under a gay exterior, he had
resolutely determined to be gay, and conquer his
ill-starred passion.  From the first moment he had seen
Willard Drummond, an uneasy consciousness that he
had beheld him somewhere before was ever upon him.
He thought of the secret marriage he had long ago
beheld, and he <i>thought</i> Mr. Drummond looked
suspiciously like the bridegroom on that occasion; but he
"pooh-poohed" the notion as preposterous, and strove to
forget it.  It was nearly dark when he had beheld that
"run-away pair," as he called them; and he could not
distinctly see the face of the man&mdash;their general
appearance was alike, but not sufficiently so to warrant his
speaking on the subject; and, of course, it could not
have been Mr. Drummond, the betrothed of Sibyl Campbell.
So he had hitherto scouted the idea until he had
nearly forgotten it; but now, strange to say, it came
back to him more vividly than ever.
</p>

<p>
While many suspicious thoughts of Willard Drummond,
but not one of Sibyl, were passing through his
mind, Mrs. Brantwell was still sobbing on the sofa, in
passionate grief.
</p>

<p>
"Now, really, Harriet, this is wrong&mdash;this is sinful.
You know," said Mr. Brantwell, fidgetting uneasily,
"such violent grief is forbidden.  We should be resigned
to the dispensations of Providence, no matter in what
shape they come."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Brantwell, go away!  I don't believe this is
a dispensation of Providence; it is all the villainy of that
miserable wretch, Courtney!  And to think we should
have kept him here, too.  Oh, Sibyl!  Sibyl!" concluded
Mrs. Brantwell, with a fresh burst of grief.
</p>

<p>
"My dear madam, let us hope for the best.  This
absurd, this monstrous, this horrible charge will soon be
explained, and Sibyl set at liberty," said Stafford,
soothingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know all that&mdash;I have not the slightest doubt
but she will be discharged, soon&mdash;very soon!  But think
of the horrible injustice of this deed! that she, my
beautiful, high-minded, proud-spirited Sibyl, should ever set
foot within a prison cell, much less be brought there as a
prisoner&mdash;and on her wedding-day, too!  Oh, it is cruel! it
is most unjust!  I have no words to express the
unspeakable wrong it inflicts upon her.  That her name
should be bandied on every tongue&mdash;should be proclaimed
as a felon's in all the papers&mdash;should be the topic of
every tavern far and near!  Oh, Heaven! why is this
monstrous injustice permitted?" cried Mrs. Brantwell, in
still-increasing sorrow and indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Now, really, Mrs. Brantwell," began the more moderate
spouse.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brantwell," sobbed his wife, looking indignantly
at him through her tears, "if you can stand there,
looking so cool and unmoved, it's no reason why others
should be equally heartless.  Oh, Mr. Stafford! won't
you ride to Westport and learn the issue of this arrest, or
I shall die of suspense!"
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly, madam; I shall go immediately,"
said Stafford, standing up.  "I was about to propose it
myself when you spoke."
</p>

<p>
"You will return as soon as possible?" called
Mrs. Brantwell, after him, as he left the room.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not lose a moment," said the young man, as
he ran down stairs, sprang on his horse and dashed
furiously toward the town.
</p>

<p>
As it was impossible with the utmost expedition, for
him to return before the next day, Mrs. Brantwell
prepared herself for a night of lingering torture&mdash;the torture
of suspense.  To the anxious, affectionate heart of the
good old lady, that long, sleepless night seemed endless;
and she hailed the sunlight of the next morning with joy,
as the precursor of news from Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
As the morning passed, this anxiety and suspense grew
almost unendurable.  Unable to sit down for one moment,
Mrs. Brantwell paced up and down, wringing her hands,
and twisting her fingers, and looking every other moment
down the road, whence Stafford must come.
</p>

<p>
But, with all her anxious watching, the hours passed
on; and, it was almost noon before the welcome sound
of a rapid gallop met her ear, and brought her eager,
palpitating, and trembling, to the door.  Yes, it was
Stafford, but the hope that had sprung up in her breast,
died away at sight of his face.  His horse was reeking
with foam, his clothes were disordered and travel-stained,
his hair disheveled, his face pale and haggard, as if from
sleeplessness and sorrow, and his eyes gloomy and
excited.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Stafford, what news of Sibyl?" gasped
Mrs. Brantwell, faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is just as I feared it would be!  Sibyl is fully
committed for trial," said Stafford, leaping off his horse,
and entering the parlor excitedly.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Brantwell, faint and sick, dropped into a chair,
and bowed her face in her hands, unable to speak; and
her husband took up the inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; I saw her in her prison cell, behind an iron
grating, as if she were some undoubted criminal," replied
Stafford, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"How does she bear this blow?"
</p>

<p>
Oh, when one is talking to her, she is calm, and
proud, and scornful enough; but, as she lifted her head
when I first went in, there was such fixed, utter anguish
and despair in her eyes, that I hope I may never see the
like again."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Sibyl!  When does this trial take place?"
</p>

<p>
"Next week.  It seems there are not many cases
occupying the court now; and hers occurs among the first,
at the special request of her friends."
</p>

<p>
"Have they engaged counsel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, the best lawyer in the State."
</p>

<p>
"And her brother and Drummond, how do <i>they</i> bear
this?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Captain Campbell swears, and threatens, and
looks as much like a maniac as any one I ever want to
see.  Mr. Drummond is calm; but there is something in
his very calmness more indicative of grief than all Guy's
more violent sorrow.  They have engaged lodgings at
Westport, and will remain there until after the trial."
</p>

<p>
"Is there any doubt, any fear, about the issue?"
</p>

<p>
"None in the least; there <i>cannot</i> be, you know.  It is
impossible, utterly impossible, there can be an instant's
doubt about her acquittal.  The trial, therefore, will be
nothing but a serious farce; but it is the infernal
injustice, begging your reverence's pardon, of making Sibyl
Campbell a principal actor in it, to stand before the gaze
of hundreds in the prisoner's dock, that is so inhuman.
Oh, there does not, there <i>cannot</i> exist a human being on
the face of the earth, so lost to reason as to believe she
could be guilty of such a crime."
</p>

<p>
"On what day next week does the trial take place?"
asked Mr. Brantwell.
</p>

<p>
"It opens next Tuesday, I believe.  And Mrs. Brantwell,
I have heard that you are to be subp[oe]naed as a
witness."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I would have gone in any case," said Mrs. Brantwell,
faintly.  "My poor Sibyl!" and with another burst
of tears her head fell on the table again.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Mrs. Brantwell, you will make yourself ill
by this foolish indulgence of grief," said her husband,
uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"And there is no real necessity for it," said Stafford,
feeling it his duty to say something consoling.  "Sibyl
will most certainly be acquitted."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't talk to me, either of you," said Mrs. Brantwell,
petulantly.  "You are men, and can't understand
how this will darken all Sibyl's future life.  I feel, I
know she will never recover from it."
</p>

<p>
There was an embarrassing pause, and then Mr. Brantwell
said:
</p>

<p>
"I will go to Westport the day before the trial comes
on, and stay there until Sibyl is discharged, poor girl!  I
suppose she and Mr. Drummond will immediately sail
for Europe until this unhappy affair is forgotten."
</p>

<p>
"Most likely.  And now I must bid you both good-morning!"
</p>

<p>
"Why! will you not wait for dinner?  Where are you
going?"
</p>

<p>
"To Westport.  Not to leave it again until this miserable
trial is Over.  Good-by."  And Stafford hurried
from the house, and mounting his still reeking horse,
rode rapidly away.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX.
<br><br>
SIBYL'S DOOM.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Great Heaven! how could thy vengeance light<br>
  So bitterly on one so bright?<br>
  How could the hand that gave such charms,<br>
  Blast them again in Love's own arms?"&mdash;MOORE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As Stafford had said, a subp[oe]na was served on
Mrs. Brantwell, to be present at the great trial about
which everybody was talking.  That good lady,
who had determined already to go, regarded it as a
useless ceremony; but Fate seemed determined to deprive
her of that melancholy consolation, for two days before
the eventful one on which the trial was to take place,
poor Mrs. Brantwell, worn out by excitement and constant
weeping, was seized with such a violent sick headache,
that she was utterly unable to leave her bed.  In
vain, when the day "big with fate" came, did she attempt
to rise.  At the first effort she was seized with such a
deadly faintness&mdash;such a blinding giddiness, that she was
instantly forced to go to bed again.  And there, half
delirious, with her head throbbing and beating like mad, she
was forced to lie, while her physician wrote a certificate
of her inability to attend, which Mr. Brantwell was to
convey to Westport.
</p>

<p>
How that day passed, and the next, and the next,
Mrs. Brantwell never knew.  Lying in her darkened chamber,
with bandages wet with vinegar bound around her burning
forehead, with servants tiptoeing in and out, and
speaking in hushed whispers, the time passed as it does
in a dream.  With her mind as well as her body utterly
prostrate, she was spared the suspense concerning the
position of Sibyl she must otherwise have suffered.
</p>

<p>
But on the fourth day, Saturday, though weak and
languid, she was able to rise, and, with the assistance of
Jenny, descended to the parlor, where, smothered in
shawls, she lay rocking back and forth in her large easy
chair.
</p>

<p>
And now, recovered from the first prostration of bodily
illness, she thought of the time that had passed, and
began to feel all the tortures of doubt and agonizing
suspense again.  Sibyl's trial must be over by this time,
and&mdash;<i>what had been the result?</i>
</p>

<p>
So unendurable grew this uncertainty, that she was
about to dispatch a messenger to Westport to learn the
result of the trial, when the clatter of horses' hoofs before
the door arrested her attention, and the next instant the
door was thrown open, and Will Stafford stood before
her.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Will Stafford; but so changed that she almost
screamed as she saw him.  Worn, haggard, and ghastly;
with convulsed brow, white lips, and despairing eyes;
with such a look of passionate grief, anguish, and despair
that the scream was frozen on her lips; and white, rigid,
and speechless, she stood staring, unable to utter a word.
</p>

<p>
Without speaking, almost without looking at her, he
threw himself into a chair, and buried his face in his
hands.
</p>

<p>
Oh! what meant that look, that action, that ominous
silence?  For one moment the sight seemed leaving
Mrs. Brantwell's eyes&mdash;the power of life seemed dying out in
her heart; but by a mighty effort of her will she resisted
the deadly faintness that was creeping over her, and
asked, in a voice so low and tremulous, that it was almost
inaudible:
</p>

<p>
"What of Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
A groan, that seemed to rend the heart from which it
came, burst from the lips of Stafford.
</p>

<p>
"What of Sibyl?" repeated Mrs. Brantwell, breathing
hard, in her effort to be calm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Mrs. Brantwell, do not ask!" exclaimed Stafford,
in a stifling voice.
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, Sibyl!" were the only words the white,
quivering lips could utter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! how can I tell her?" cried Stafford, springing
up, and wildly beginning to pace the room.
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl! what of her?" wailed Mrs. Brantwell,
pressing her hands to her heart.
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl is&mdash;oh, Heaven? how can I speak the terrible
words?" exclaimed the excited young man, pacing up
and down like one demented.
</p>

<p>
"Heavens! will you tell me before I go mad?" cried
Mrs. Brantwell, becoming as much excited as himself.
</p>

<p>
"Then listen&mdash;since I must repeat her awful fate!
Sibyl has been tried, convicted, and <i>doomed to die</i>!"
</p>

<p>
The look that Mrs. Brantwell's face wore that
moment, never left the memory of Will Stafford.  There
was a sound as of many waters in her ears, a sudden
darkness before her eyes, her brain reeled, and her head
dropped helplessly on the arm of her chair.
</p>

<p>
Stafford, in alarm, flew to the bell; but overcoming,
with a mighty effort, that deadly inclination to swoon,
she lifted up her head, and half raised her hand, in a faint
motion to stop him.
</p>

<p>
"I want nothing; it is over," she said, tremulously.
"Sit down before me and tell me all.  The worst is over,
and I can bear anything now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! it was horrible, monstrous, outrageous, this
sentence," exclaimed Stafford, with a burst of passionate
grief.  "I never dreamed for an instant&mdash;never did&mdash;that
she would be condemned.  Oh, curse that Courtney!
Heaven's malediction rest on him, here and hereafter!"
he hissed through his clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all!  Oh, tell me all!" said Mrs. Brantwell,
trying to steady her trembling voice.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could!  I came for that purpose; but I am
going mad, I think," said Stafford, throwing himself into
a chair with something like a howl of mingled rage and
despair.  "<i>She</i> told me to come and tell you; nothing
else could have made me leave Westport while she
lives."
</p>

<p>
"Was it Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Mr. Brantwell could not travel as fast as I
could, and will not be here till to-morrow, and I&mdash;oh!  I
rode as if the old demon were at my heels all the way&mdash;and
I'll never rest easy again till I've put a bullet
through Courtney's brain; for, he's the cause of it all,
with his diabolical circumstantial evidence," exclaimed
Stafford, with still increasing vehemence.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stafford, do give me the particulars!"
</p>

<p>
"You know the trial was to commence on Tuesday?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, as soon as the doors of the court-house were
thrown open, the galleries, and staircases, and every
corner of the building were filled to suffocation by an eager
crowd.  I got in among the rest of the rabble, and
secured a good place where I could see and hear everything.
Owing to some cause or other, the people had to
wait a good while; and just as they were getting
clamorous and impatient, they saw the carriage making its
way slowly through the mass of people that lined and
crowded the streets, unable to obtain an entrance into the
court-house.  Then every one was on tiptoe with expectation
to see the prisoner, the fame of whose wealth and
beauty, and the strange circumstances attending her
arrest, had been blazoned the whole country round.  It
was with the greatest difficulty that a passage could be
forced through the crowd as she entered, dressed in deepest
black, closely veiled, and in the custody of the high
sheriff.  Captain Campbell and Drummond followed closely
after, and took their places near her.  As she took her
seat, you might have heard a pin drop, so intense was the
silence; but when, a moment after, she threw back her
vail, and her pale, beautiful face, with its dark, proud,
scornful eyes, that went wandering for an instant round
with contemptuous disdain for the gaping crowd, a
low, deep murmur of admiration, surprise, and pity,
passed through the vast assemblage of human beings;
and the next instant they were profoundly still once more.
</p>

<p>
"The jury were already impaneled, and the presiding
judge, and the State attorney, and Sibyl's counsel, had
taken their places, so the trial immediately commenced.
When the clerk of the court put the customary
question&mdash;'Guilty or not guilty'&mdash;I wish you had seen the slender
form of Sibyl tower aloft, and her glorious eyes flash,
and her beautiful lip curl with scorn and disdain, as she
answered:
</p>

<p>
"'<i>Not</i> guilty! your honor.'
</p>

<p>
"There is no use in my telling you the State attorney's
charge.  You'll see it all in the papers, if you have any
curiosity on the subject.  All I need say is, that it seemed
to destroy every favorable impression made on the minds
of the jury by the youth, beauty, and sex of the prisoner.
He spoke of the pain it gave him to be obliged to make
this charge against a woman, whose interesting appearance
he saw had already made a deep impression on the
minds of all present; but he trusted the gentlemen of the
jury would not allow themselves to be carried away by
their feelings, for 'appearances were often deceitful;'
and he made a long preamble about demons wearing the
forms of angels of light, and of the crimes other women,
gentle and loving before, had been induced to commit in
sudden paroxysms of jealousy&mdash;as this crime had been&mdash;as
he was prepared to prove.  He spoke of many cases of
women&mdash;some of which had come under his own immediate
knowledge&mdash;of women stabbing themselves, their
lovers, their rivals, in fits of jealous passion.  He spoke
of the well-known jealousy and vindictiveness that had
ever characterized the race from which the interesting
prisoner at the bar had sprung, and that he would soon
show that she had been ever noted&mdash;even since childhood&mdash;for
these same faults.  Then he drew a pathetic picture
of the victim&mdash;her youth, her gentleness, her trusting
simplicity&mdash;until every woman present was sobbing as if
her heart would break.  But when he concluded by saying
that the murdered girl was the wife of the prisoner's
lover&mdash;married to him in secret, as he would shortly
prove&mdash;a thrill ran through every heart."
</p>

<p>
"<i>His wife!</i>" exclaimed Mrs. Brantwell, looking up in
dismay and incredulity.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mrs. Brantwell, his wife; and she <i>was</i>, too,"
said Stafford, sorrowfully.  "When Willard Drummond&mdash;who
had all this time been standing motionless, his hat
drawn over his brow&mdash;heard the words, he started, reeled,
and turned as deadly white as if he had received a pistol-shot
through the heart.  Sibyl lifted her wild, black eyes,
and reading in that look, that action, the truth of the
words, with a long, low cry dropped her face in her
hands, with such a look of utter despair, that every heart
stood still.  Captain Campbell sprang up as if some one
had speared him, and would have throttled Drummond
on the spot, I firmly believe, if a policeman had not
interfered, and held him back.
</p>

<p>
"The first witness called was an old Methodist minister,
who deposed, on oath, that he had married Willard
Drummond&mdash;whom he promptly identified&mdash;to a young
girl called Christina Tomlinson, about a year and a half
previously, as nearly as he could then recollect.  They
were married at night, without attendants; and the bride
seemed very much frightened.  He concluded by giving a
description of her, which exactly tallied with that of little
Christie.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Tom was then called, and affirmed that on the
night in question, Christie had gone to Westport with
Drummond; and when they returned late at night, she
found her niece lying senseless in his arms, which
circumstance he accounted for by some plausible reason she
had now forgotten.  Being cross-examined, she affirmed
that the deceased and the young man Drummond were
always together, after the prisoner left the island; and
she, Mrs. Tom, not liking their intimacy, had endeavored
to put a stop to it, but in vain.  She could not swear
positively that her niece and Miss Campbell were bad
friends, but she did not think they were on good terms;
and her principal reason for ending the intimacy between
the deceased and Mr. Drummond, had been the fear of
the prisoner's anger, which she knew, when excited, was
extremely violent.  That on the night of the murder the
deceased had appeared out of spirits, and complaining of
a headache, had retired early.  That when she awoke in
the morning she found her gone, and the house-door
open, things which had never happened before.  That
she had no suspicions of the truth, until Miss Campbell
came in and told her her niece was murdered.  That
thereupon they had gone down to the beach together, and
she had identified a handkerchief belonging to her niece,
marked with her name, deeply clotted with blood.  That
the prisoner&mdash;who had never hitherto appeared to care
for Christie&mdash;seemed deeply, almost wildly agitated that
morning, which had surprised her (the witness) not a
little at the time.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Tom was then dismissed, and Captain Campbell
was called to take the stand.  A low murmur of
sympathy ran around as they observed his pale and
haggard face; and all listened with breathless interest to the
testimony he reluctantly gave.  He said that on the
evening of the murder, being on the island, Christie had
approached and given him a note, which she directed him
to give to his sister.  That he had done so; and that
Sibyl had appeared violently agitated upon receiving it,
and impetuously insisted upon going to the island that
night.  That he had urged her not to go, but she had
insisted; and upon his telling her Carl Henley was
going over that evening, she had said she would accompany
him; and he had then left the room, and he did not
see her again for upward of a fortnight.
</p>

<p>
"Carl Henley next took the stand, and after the usual
oath, stated that on the evening of the murder he had
taken Sibyl across to the island.  That in the boat she
had talked wildly, though he could not recollect what
she had said.  That she had left him when they had
reached the shore, and had run up the rocks, through the
storm, in the direction of the lodge.  That he had returned
to the cottage; and shortly after went to bed, leaving
'Aunt Tom,' as he called her, and Christie down stairs.
That about midnight, being awakened by the violence of
the storm, he had got up and distinctly heard a cry of
'murder,' though whether it was in Christie's voice or
not, he could not say.  That a moment after, by the light
of a flash of lightning, he had seen a woman flying past,
with long black hair streaming behind her, 'jest like her,'
he expressed himself, pointing to Sibyl.  Being
cross-examined, he swore positively to seeing the woman, whom
he said he took, at the time, to be Sibyl; and nothing
her counsel could say could weaken his testimony in the
least.
</p>

<p>
"There were several other witnesses examined; but
though I have forgotten their testimony, it all went to
prove that Christie was beloved by everybody who knew
her but Sibyl; that she had not an enemy in the world
but Sibyl.  Among others, came that infernal Courtney,
who swore positively that he knew Sibyl to be jealous of
Christie; and in proof of which, adduced several circumstances
that seemed to have a great deal of weight with
the bench; that Sibyl's agitation upon receiving Christie's
note was so palpable, that he began to have misgivings
on the spot; that when he beheld her, the following
day, after coming from the island, she seemed like one
deprived of reason, as if 'remorse for some crime'
preyed upon her.  Oh!  I could have strangled the
white-livered villain on the spot," said Stafford, grinding his
teeth.  "Then the court was adjourned until the following
day, and the prisoner removed.
</p>

<p>
"Next day it was the same.  There was little new
evidence against Sibyl; but it seemed clear to all that
the jury had already made up their minds as to her guilt;
and that her youth and beauty only seemed to aggravate
her crime.
</p>

<p>
"Then the defense was taken up; and Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; made
a very good speech, and did all he could to disabuse the
minds of the jury, but it was like beating the air.  He
did all he could, but that was too little to save Sibyl.
</p>

<p>
"The State attorney rose again, and set aside all P.'s
arguments in a cool, contemptuous manner, that carried
conviction to the minds of the spectators.  And then the
judge arose to sum up the evidence and charge the jury.
In his mind there seemed not the faintest shadow of a
doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner, I cannot remember
what he said; but I know, despite his gray hairs, I
felt a demoniacal desire to knock him down all the time
he was speaking.  Then the jury withdrew to deliberate;
and during their brief absence the silence of death
reigned in that crowded court-room.  Every eye was
bent upon Sibyl; but after hearing of Willard's marriage
she never lifted her head.  It was as if the heaviest blow
that could possibly befall her had passed, and life or
death mattered nothing to her now.
</p>

<p>
"The jury was not absent ten minutes ere they
returned.  Their sudden entrance was ominous; but their
grave, stern faces were more ominous still.  I had to
grasp the arm of a man beside whom I stood, for I felt
myself trembling in every limb.  The jurors all stood
erect, and every breath seemed suspended.
</p>

<p>
"'Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your
verdict?' asked the venerable judge.
</p>

<p>
"'We have, your honor,' responded the foreman.
</p>

<p>
"'How say you, then?  Is the prisoner at the bar
guilty or not guilty of the crime with which she is
charged?'
</p>

<p>
"'Guilty!' was the awful response.
</p>

<p>
"At that word, there rose a cry that thrilled through
every heart; and Willard Drummond, like a man possessed
of a demon, fled from the house, while the appalled
crowd fell back in turn before him.  A dreadful silence
followed; and then the judge arose, and in a voice that
trembled in spite of himself, said:
</p>

<p>
"'Prisoner, arise, and receive the sentence of the law.'
</p>

<p>
"Every breath was suspended, every voice was hushed,
but the prisoner neither moved nor stirred.  She seemed
frozen into the attitude in which she had fallen, at the
news of Willard Drummond's perfidy.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Brantwell, who was standing near, with a face
pale with deepest pity, touched her on the shoulder, and
said, in a faltering voice:
</p>

<p>
"'Sibyl, my dearest girl, arise; let me assist you.'
</p>

<p>
"He took her arm and supported her to her feet; but
when she lifted her head, all beheld a face so cold, so
white, so rigid, with such frozen eyes and colorless lips,
such an awful look of woman's deepest woe, that every
face grew pale, and every eye was filled with tears.  As
for me, I felt as if I were going mad.  I heard the judge
saying something&mdash;to save my soul I could not tell what,
until the last awful words met my ears:
</p>

<p>
"'Prisoner, the sentence of the court is, that you be
taken hence to the prison from whence you came, and
from thence to the place of execution, and that there you
be hanged by the neck until you are dead!'
</p>

<p>
"I could listen no longer.  How I burst from the
crowd I know not, but I reached the open air frantic,
almost maddened.  The crowd poured out after me, and
presently the prisoner appeared, between your husband,
her brother, and the sheriff.
</p>

<p>
"I saw no one but Sibyl.  Her face wore the same
fixed, stony look it had done when she arose&mdash;not a
muscle had quivered.  It was evident she heard not, cared
not for the awful doom about to befall her.  I broke
through the crowd like a madman, until I stood before
her.
</p>

<p>
"'Sibyl&mdash;Sibyl!' I cried out.
</p>

<p>
"Something in my tone arrested her, and she looked
vacantly at me.  She passed her hand across her forehead,
as if to clear away a mist, and then said, in a low,
dreamy tone:
</p>

<p>
"'Ah, Mr. Stafford, I have a request to make of you.'
</p>

<p>
"'What is it?' I asked, scarcely able to speak.
</p>

<p>
"'Hasten to my dear friend, Mrs. Brantwell, and tell
her what has happened; but, tell her not to be sorry for
me, for it is better as it is.  Guy, I am tired; take me
away.'
</p>

<p>
"She said all this in a strange, weary tone, like one
that is bewildered.  I saw them help her into a coach,
saw it driven away; and then I went to the hotel,
feeling&mdash;well, it's no use trying now to tell you how I felt.
Long before daylight this morning, I started to come
here&mdash;and that is all."

CHAPTER XXXI.
<br><br>
THE BANKRUPT HEART.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  Oh, break, break, break! poor bankrupt, break at once,<br>
  To prison, soul!  Ne'er hope for liberty!"&mdash;SHAKESPEARE.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every sense<br>
  Had been unstrung by pangs intense,<br>
  And each frail fiber of her brain<br>
  As bow-strings when released by rain,<br>
  The erring arrows launch aside&mdash;<br>
  Sent forth her thoughts all wild and wide."&mdash;BYRON.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was a long pause.  Then Mrs. Brantwell
raised her head, and asked.
</p>

<p>
"When do you return to Westport?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot go before to-morrow; my horse is unfit for
the journey."
</p>

<p>
"Then I will accompany you."
</p>

<p>
"But my dear madam&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stafford, not a word.  I will go!"
</p>

<p>
She spoke in a tone there was no disobeying; so Stafford
was forced to assent; and soon after Mrs. Brantwell
left the room and sought her own apartment.  The light
breakfast next morning was untouched by either of
them; and as soon as it was over, Mrs. Brantwell hastily
threw on her bonnet and shawl, and entered the carriage
that stood waiting to convey her to Westport.
</p>

<p>
Some time before evening they reached the town&mdash;now
so crowded with strangers that it would have been
impossible to have secured lodgings, had not Captain
Campbell given up his rooms to the use of Mrs. Brantwell
while she should remain.
</p>

<p>
Too utterly exhausted in her present weak state to
visit the prison that night, Mrs. Brantwell immediately
retired to her room, and desired the waiter to send
Captain Campbell to her.
</p>

<p>
She scarcely recognized him, so altered had he become
in those few days; the old hopeful look was gone, and in
its place the darkest, gloomiest despair.
</p>

<p>
The meeting was a very sad and very silent one.
Mrs. Brantwell pressed the hand he extended with deepest
pity and warmest sympathy, but said nothing.  Her
silence was more eloquent than words.  At last&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"When did you see Sibyl?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not since the day of the trial," he answered, moodily.
</p>

<p>
"No!" she exclaimed, in surprise.  "How is that?"
</p>

<p>
"She would not see me; she would not see any one.
I attended her to the cell, and there she bade me go&mdash;she
would be alone; she insisted on it; she would not even
see Mr. Brantwell.  I left her, and went the next day, and
the next, and the next, but still the same answer was
returned; she would see no one.  From the moment she
left the court-house she had thrown herself upon her bed,
and she would not touch the food they offered her; she
would not speak one word, only repeating that
peremptory demand to be alone."
</p>

<p>
"My poor, poor Sibyl!  And Mr. Drummond, where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"I know not.  When he heard the sentence of the
court, he sprang on his horse and dashed away like a
madman.  May Heaven's heaviest vengeance light on
him and that black-hearted traitor, Courtney! for between
them they have brought her to this!"  And Captain
Campbell's face grew absolutely livid with the storm of
passion that swept across it.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest boy, hush!  We must forgive our
enemies, you know, if we expect to be forgiven.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive them!  Yes! if I ever meet them, I'll send
them to another world, with a bullet through their brains,
in search of forgiveness!" he fiercely replied.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Guy! do not say such dreadful things!  You do
not mean it, I know; but it is wrong nevertheless."
</p>

<p>
He only replied with a smile&mdash;but such a smile!
Mrs. Brantwell turned away with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow I will visit the prison.  I feel sure Sibyl
will receive me."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so; but there is no telling.  You can make
the effort nevertheless."
</p>

<p>
"You will accompany me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly.  And as you look fatigued now, I
will leave you to seek the necessary repose.  Good-night."
</p>

<p>
He was gone with the same dark, rigid look on his
face, that made Mrs. Brantwell's heart ache; and she
sought her couch with a mind deeply disturbed by the
thought of to-morrow's interview.
</p>

<p>
Next day, immediately after her slender breakfast,
Captain Campbell made his appearance in her room.  As
the prison was but a short distance from the hotel, they
were to walk; and drawing her arm within his own,
Captain Campbell set out.
</p>

<p>
The streets were already crowded with people, drawn
hither by the news of the great trial, and determined to
wait now to see the execution.
</p>

<p>
Groups were assembled on every corner, discussing in
low tones the expected event, and the murder.  Every
eye was bent on Captain Campbell as he passed; some
knowing him to be the brother of the condemned; others
supposing him to be her false lover, and the elderly lady
on his arm, her mother.  These insolent stares were met
by such fixed, fierce glances on the part of the young
man, that every eye fell, and every one shrank back to let
him pass.
</p>

<p>
They reached the prison, and were admitted by the
warden, who glanced at Captain Campbell in the deepest
distress.
</p>

<p>
"We wish to be admitted to my sister's cell, Mr. Dent,"
said Captain Campbell.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; but if you please, sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;there!  I know what you would say,"
impatiently interrupted the young man.  "But my sister
will receive this lady.  Lead on, sir."
</p>

<p>
With a deep sigh of compassion, the old man obeyed;
and they followed him through a long, gloomy hall, until
they reached a door, before which the warden paused.
</p>

<p>
Fumbling among a large bunch of keys, he produced
one which unlocked the door; and stepping back, he
flung the door open and signed to them to pass in.
</p>

<p>
They did so, and paused on the threshold.  For there
before them was a sight that struck them dumb; that
sent the life-blood curdling in horror to their hearts.
</p>

<p>
Crouching in a corner, and glaring upon them with
her wild, vacant black eyes; every trace of color faded
from her lips, leaving even the beautiful lips blue and
livid; her long hair streaming wildly down her back; her
hands held out before her, as if to keep them off, she sat.
Well might they stare, while the very life-blood froze in
their hearts.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII.
<br><br>
ANOTHER STORM WITHIN AND WITHOUT.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;"Let her rave,<br>
  And prophesy ten thousand, thousand horrors<br>
  I could join with her now, and bid them come;<br>
  They fit the present fury of my soul.<br>
  The stings of love and rage are fixed within,<br>
  And drive me on to madness."&mdash;ROWE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Loathing the sunlight, hating himself, frantic,
maddened, Willard Drummond fled from the courthouse,
with the terrific words of the judge searing
his heart, burning his brain, scathing his memory, ringing
in his ears, like the last awful trump of the mighty
arch-angel.
</p>

<p>
Whither he went, what became of him, he cared not,
knew not.  Driving his spurs into his horse's Hanks, until
the maddened beast fairly flew over the ground, he fled
on, and on, and on, with heart on fire, his head in a
whirl&mdash;feeling as though a wheel of flame were crashing
through it; knowing, feeling conscious of but one thing,
that Sibyl was condemned to die.
</p>

<p>
And through him&mdash;through his fault; <i>that</i> was the
thought that whelmed his soul in anguish and despair.
All his treachery, all his falsehood, all his duplicity were
known to her now; and dying, she would loathe, hate,
and despise him.  He could have cursed himself; he
could have cursed earth, and heaven, and all mankind
in that moment, while the tempests of agony, remorse,
despair, and anguish were raging in his soul.
</p>

<p>
And on, still on, he flew, unheeding the passing
hours&mdash;unheeding whither he went, until his exhausted and
panting horse fell helpless beneath him.
</p>

<p>
That was the first thing that brought him to his
senses.  He sprang off the back of the foam-covered and
trembling animal, and conscious that his headlong speed
and frenzied looks must excite distrust and suspicion, he
strove to calm himself, and lead his horse to the nearest
inn.
</p>

<p>
He lifted his head to look about him, and found he
had nearly reached N&mdash;&mdash;.  Assisting his horse to rise he
led him slowly toward an unpretending little farm-house
that chanced to be near, and knocked loudly at the door.
</p>

<p>
The summons was answered by a boy, who stared at
Willard with a look of blank dismay.
</p>

<p>
"I have ridden my horse until, as you perceive, he is
unable to proceed any farther.  Can he remain here for
the night?" he asked, abruptly.
</p>

<p>
The sound of his voice brought a man to the door,
smoking a short, black pipe.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"This 'ere man wants to know, if his hoss can stay
here to-night, and be took care of," explained the lad.
</p>

<p>
"Sartin, sartin," responded the man, heartily; "and
you, too, sir, if you'll honor us with your company.
Johnny, take the gentleman's hoss off to the barn.  Walk
in, sir&mdash;walk in; you look quite as near used up yourself
as your beast does.  Walk in, and sit down."
</p>

<p>
Accepting his hospitality with a brief nod, Willard
followed him into a large, clean-looking room, where a
woman sat knitting, and two girls sat sewing.
</p>

<p>
The female portion of the establishment got up and
dropped him a courtesy, while the old man presented him
with a chair.  Willard removed his hat from his hot and
throbbing brow, and shook back his long, dark, clustering
locks, while the girls glanced at him askance, with
looks of mingled admiration and fear at his wild and
excited appearance.
</p>

<p>
"Come from the town, I reckon?" said his host, drawing
a chair opposite Willard's and resuming his pipe.
</p>

<p>
A brief "yes," was his sole reply.
</p>

<p>
"Great doings going on there, I hear; lots of people
crowding to it every day."
</p>

<p>
Another "yes," brief and cold, was his answer.
</p>

<p>
"Great talk, too, about this trial.  You've heard tell
of it in course?"
</p>

<p>
Still another "yes," briefer, sterner, and colder than
before, was Willard's answer; but his talkative host was
not abashed.
</p>

<p>
"Very sad affair, I must say," he went on, shaking his
head; "and very strange all through.  It's wonderful
how wimmin will do things when they's in a passion.
They say this Miss Campbell went over jest a purpose to
kill this other gal, and chucked her body into the sea
when she was done."
</p>

<p>
Here he waited for a reply, but received none; for
Willard, with his face shaded by his hand and his falling
hair, was thinking, with a bursting heart, of Sibyl, and
heard not a word the garrulous old man said.
</p>

<p>
"This Miss Campbell's beau&mdash;what she was going to
be married to when she got took up&mdash;must be a precious
villain.  They say he was married to the other young gal
on the sly, and nobody ever knowed nothing about it.
I'd like to get my hands on him, and give him a good
hoss whipping&mdash;I vow I would.  A little hanging
wouldn't hurt him a mite morn'n her!"
</p>

<p>
At this expose of his feelings, the worthy man again
paused for a reply that came not; for Willard Drummond,
buried in his own bitter thoughts, was dead to all
the world around.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there's a great crowd going to town," resumed
the old man, thoughtfully, as a light wagon, filled with
people, rattled past; "but it ain't no circumstance to
what will go to see her hung.  I'll go to see that myself;
and I'll take the old woman and the girls, too.  I've
been promising them a treat this long time.  S'p'ose you'll
be there, too?" he added, determined to get an answer by
some means.
</p>

<p>
But still his strange guest maintained his moody
silence, and the old man gave up the effort in despair,
and turned the tide of his eloquence upon "Johnny," who
entered at this moment, in numberless inquiries concerning
the state of the "gentleman's hoss."  The girls
looked at each other and giggled, and the old woman
peered at Willard suspiciously over her spectacles.
</p>

<p>
A summons to supper was the first thing that aroused
him from his reverie; but, with a head giddy, a brain
throbbing with tumultuous thoughts, the very sight of
food was loathsome to him.  Rising to his feet, and
standing with difficulty, owing to his strange dizziness,
he said:
</p>

<p>
"As you kindly invited me to remain all night, may I
ask to be shown to my room?  I do not feel quite well,
and I believe I will retire."
</p>

<p>
The old woman gave her husband a warning glance
that revealed plainer than words the danger of having
so suspicious a guest in the house; but, the "good,
lazy soul," totally regardless of it in his hospitality,
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Sartin, sartin, sir; but won't you take something
first?  Susan's tea and strawberry short-cake is jest about
the tallest sort o' vittals anybody can eat when they ain't
well.  Do sit down, sir, and take a little snack."
</p>

<p>
"Not any, thank you," said Willard, faintly, as his
headache grew more intense.  "I wish to retire immediately."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well, then!" said the old man, adding, in a
distinct whisper, "Gals, you'll have to give your room
up to the gentleman.  This way, sir, if you please."
</p>

<p>
Willard followed his hospitable guide up a flight of
rickety stairs, into a small and scantily furnished little
bed-room, hung round with feminine articles of apparel,
and containing a comfortable bed.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you'll sleep well, sir," said his host, as he
ushered him in.  "It's a poor place for the like of you,
but it's the best we've got."
</p>

<p>
"It's all I could wish," said Willard, who couldn't
have told for the life of him, whether it was sumptuously
furnished or otherwise.  And then returning his host a
good-night, he threw himself on the bed, and strove to
forget in sleep the dull, heavy aching of his head and
heart.
</p>

<p>
"A queer chap, that!" said the old man, as he slowly
plodded his way down stairs.  "Looks as if he had seen
trouble lately.  Well, this world is full of trouble;
nothing but trouble for rich and poor alike, and always will
be to the end, I do believe."  And with this hopeful and
encouraging view of the world in general, he opened the
door and entered the bosom of his family.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now, Jonathan," exclaimed his spouse, in a
voice more remarkable for shrillness than sweetness, "I
wonders at your harboring every highwayman and sulky
stranger you don't know nothing about, in this way.
How do you know we won't get our throats cut in cold
blood afore morning, with that there dark-looking, silent
man in the house?  How do you know but he's a robber,
or suthin'?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe he's a robber," said Jonathan, quietly,
sitting down at the table; "he don't look like that.
Seems more like as if he had some heavy trouble or other
a-weighing on his mind.  Anyway, you wouldn't have me
turn away a tired critter from the door, would you, old
woman?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, if he wasn't so suspicious-looking," grumbled
the old woman; "but, for to go and sit there all the
evening, and never speak one word, is a <i>leetle</i> too much."
</p>

<p>
"People don't talk when they are in trouble, I tell
you!" retorted her spouse.  "And now I think on't,
perhaps he's some friend or other of that poor young girl
that's going to be hung.  I'm sure, if he is, it's enough to
make him silent.  Fill my cup, Susan."
</p>

<p>
"He's real good-looking, anyway," remarked one of
the girls, "with the loveliest of black eyes."
</p>

<p>
"And the sweetest curling hair!" said the other.
</p>

<p>
"And the whitest teeth&mdash;did you notice?" added the
first.
</p>

<p>
"No; but I saw his hands; they <i>was</i> white as a
lady's!" chimed in the second.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe he's a bad man, either; he don't look
like it," said the first.
</p>

<p>
"I declare to massy! if Sary ain't gone and fell in
love with him!" exclaimed Johnny, with a chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"I hain't neither!" said "Sary," angrily, with
reddening cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there, don't get quarreling about him!" broke
in the mother.  "The man's going away to-morrow
morning; that's one blessing!"
</p>

<p>
But neither that morrow, nor the next, nor the next
did Willard Drummond go; for when morning came,
they found him tossing in the delirium of a fever.  In
dire alarm, a doctor was sent for, who said he was ill
from over-excitement of some kind, and was threatened
with brain fever; but that with proper care it might be
warded off.
</p>

<p>
Querulous as the good lady of the house might seem
outwardly, at heart she was kind and motherly; and all
her sympathies were aroused for the sick young stranger.
She listened in wonder and pity to his wild ravings, from
which she could easily gather that he was in some way
connected with the dire event that was occupying every
tongue&mdash;how, she could not tell.  That he was of a station
far superior to their own, they also could see; and
with the most tender and unceasing care they watched
over him night and day.
</p>

<p>
But with all their kind nursing, three weeks elapsed
before he was able to leave his bed, and another passed
before he was strong enough to walk about.
</p>

<p>
Of Sibyl and the rest he had heard nothing during all
this time.  All exciting topics they had been forbidden
by the doctor to speak of before him; and that, as the one
exciting theme of every tongue, in particular.  In fact
had they been willing, they had very little to tell, for
they had few visitors from the outer world to their quiet
little cottage.
</p>

<p>
One evening, as still weak and languid, he sat by the
window, watching the sun sink red and fiery behind a
dense black cloud, and thinking bitterly how, by the
impetuous violence of his own headstrong passions, his
own life had been similarly clouded, the lad Johnny came
in, with wide-opened eyes and mouth, all aglow with
some wonderful news.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Johnny, boy, what is it?" said his father, who
sat, as Willard had first seen him, serenely smoking his
pipe.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father!  I've just seen old Toller, from Westport,"
said the boy, excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, lad, what's the news from there?" inquired his
father.
</p>

<p>
Willard, too, looked around with a start.
</p>

<p>
"Why, he says people are crowding to it now, from
every place; that every house is full of people come to
see the woman hung."
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond's face grew livid, and his brain
reeled at the words.
</p>

<p>
"He says she was raving crazy for awhile, and that
delayed it so long; but the doctor's brought her to, and
now the execution's going to take place day after
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
His mother's warning glance toward Willard came too
late.  With the look of a madman, he rushed from the
house.  A horse, the boy had been riding, stood saddled
at the gate.  He sprang on his back, and striking him a
furious blow, dashed off under the first moment's fierce
excitement, as he had done before, unheeding, uncaring
whither he went.
</p>

<p>
He saw not, heeded not the coming storm; but one
idea filled heart and brain&mdash;that of escaping, of flying
far away, of never again beholding the scene of so many
horrors.
</p>

<p>
Night was at hand, bearing in its dark, lowering face
the storm that all day had been threatening.  An
oppressive stillness, a burning heat filled the air, and
the old trees creaked, groaned, and tossed their long,
weird arms with a dreary moaning noise, as though in
pain.  A hot, gusty wind lifted at intervals the heavy,
dark hair off his burning brow, but without cooling it.
It rustled the dry leaves till they whirled in a shower
around him; but he heeded it not; he would hardly have
heeded the wildest hurricane in that moment.
</p>

<p>
He had reached the forest, and now his course becoming
from necessity less rapid, he could look around him
and note the change of weather.  By the last sickly light
of the dying day, he saw a tempest was at hand, and he
hailed it with a sort of mad exultation, to think that
nature, convulsed by the storm, would be so much more
in unison with the storm raging within his own breast.
</p>

<p>
He gave the frowning face of the sky but one momentary
glance, for another and far more terrible sight was
ever before his agonized eyes&mdash;it was the form, the
beautiful form of his worshiped Sibyl, swinging between
heaven and earth, convulsed in the agony of that horrible
death; exposed to the gaze, to the shouts and derision of
the mob; her lovely face darkened and convulsed until
death would mercifully put an end to her tortures.
</p>

<p>
The awful vision seemed driving him mad.  With
something like the shriek of a maniac, he struck the
animal he bestrode a furious blow to drive him on.  The
horse bounded madly on for a few paces; but at that
moment a vivid sheet of lightning blazed across their
path, and he suddenly stopped, reared himself almost
upright, and with a snort of fear turned and fled.  Faint
from recent illness, Willard lost his seat, and was hurled,
wounded and bleeding, to the earth.
</p>

<p>
And now, alone, wounded, and helpless in the vast old
woods, the storm was upon him in its might.
</p>

<p>
It is said that, in the moment that elapses before some
sudden and terrible death, all the events of our lives pass
with the rapidity of lightning through our minds.  So
was it now with Willard Drummond.  As he lay prostrate,
bleeding, and helpless, all the great wrongs he had
done, all he had made others suffer, rose before him with
a bitterness exceeding that of death.  Through him
Christie was murdered; through him Sibyl was now to
die a felon's ignominious death.
</p>

<p>
The storm was each moment increasing; and it
howled, and shrieked, and tore through the trees, as
though it had risen in vengeance against him.  He
thought of that <i>other night</i> of storm and tempest, on which
his loving, much-wronged child wife had perished by the
steel of the assassin.  He thought of Sibyl, alone and
doomed, waiting for death in her prison-cell.  And then,
with startling suddenness, flashed across his mind the
strange vision that, years before, he had seen and scoffed
at, in a far off land.  One by one, three visions had been
realized; and now only one&mdash;the death on the
scaffold&mdash;was to come.
</p>

<p>
The night; the storm; the forest; the wounded man,
all were here; and now was death to come, and end all
this mortal strife, and close forever the dark drama of his
life.
</p>

<p>
While these thoughts were yet passing through his
mind, a sound smote his ear that startled him from the
deadly stupor into which he was fast falling.  It was no
crash of storm, this; no sound of wind and rain among
the trees; but the sound of human footsteps flying
wildly through the storm.  He strove to raise himself
and cry out; but his voice was lost in the wild uproar
around; and he was about to fall back in despair, when
the fugitive from the storm struck against him, and fell
over him on the ground.
</p>

<p>
The shock of the sudden concussion nearly stunned
Willard; but the person who had fallen, uttering a sharp
ejaculation, was up again in an instant, bending over
him.
</p>

<p>
By the light of the rapid flashes of lightning, he
beheld a woman with dark, flowing hair, and wild, maniac
eyes&mdash;the same startling vision he had twice before seen
in Campbell's Isle.
</p>

<p>
With a shriek that pierced high above the storm, she
sprang up, and sped away through the woods with the
speed of an arrow shot from a bow.
</p>

<p>
The unexpected sight of this unearthly-looking visitant
was too much for nature, in his present exhausted
state, to bear; and falling heavily back, the dark night of
insensibility closed around him.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br><br>
THE DEAD ALIVE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;"Am I already mad?<br>
  And does delirium utter such sweet words<br>
  Into a dreamer's ear?"&mdash;LADY OF LYONS.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the little forest cottage, the evening preceding that
night of storm, Christie stood in the humble doorway,
watching the sun go down.
</p>

<p>
Those weary months have sadly changed our little
favorite.  The thin, wan face, has grown thinner and
wanner than ever; the angel brow paler and more
transparent; the dark, loving blue eyes darker, larger, and
wearing ever a look of deep, gentle, unchanging melancholy;
the fair, golden hair falls like threads of raveled
silk around her pearly cheek; the light step is slow and
languid; and the hectic crimson spot that each afternoon
burns on those usually colorless cheeks, bespeaks the
ravages of that fell destroyer&mdash;consumption.  Slowly
but surely she is passing away, bending her meek head
to the stroke of the destroyer, and only sighing for the
time when her weary head may find rest at last in some
little woodland grave.  Little Christie will never live to
see the midsummer rose blow.
</p>

<p>
With a quiet, fervent joy, she thinks of this as she
stands in the door-way, the last fiery ray of the red
sunlight falling, like a shadow of the glory that awaits her,
on her bent head.  With those dark, radiant, starry eyes
fixed on the fast-coming clouds, her mind strays back to
that night of deepest woe&mdash;that last night spent in her
island home.  The coming of every storm recalls it, but
never so vividly as it does to-night.  All the old tide of
her deep, unchanging love for Willard, for her destroyer&mdash;so
strong and fervent, that time, absence, and the
belief in his guilt has no power to change it&mdash;swells back
to her heart, crowned with blissful memories of the time
when she first knew and loved him, until an almost
passionate longing to be with him once more, to throw
her arms around his neck, to seal her forgiveness on his
lips, to feel his heart swelling and throbbing against her
own once more, to gaze into those dark eyes again, and
heave her last expiring sigh on that loved breast, took
possession of her.  Then came the bitter recollection that
long ere this another must be his bride, and she could
never feel the strong, fervent clasp of those dear arms
again; and with a grief that death alone could ever still,
she hid her face in her hands to keep back her fast
falling tears, while her white bosom rose and fell with
convulsive sobs.  A slow, heavy step, crashed over dried
branches around her, and she looked up, to behold the
kind, honest face of Uncle Reuben.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, thee is grieving again.  This will never do, little
Christie," he said, sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I cannot help it!  It all comes back so strangely
to-night!" said Christie, in a voice full of unshed tears.
</p>

<p>
"What does, little one?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the past, the past! the sad, beautiful past."
</p>

<p>
"Thee must forget the past, daughter, and live in the
present, and for the future," said Uncle Reuben, laying
his hand on her head.  "Thee knows what the good book
says: 'Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be
comforted.'"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I know; that promise has often sustained
me in my darkest hours.  Dear Uncle Reuben, I know I
am wicked to murmur, but bear with me a little while
until I go where the promise will be fulfilled."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thee is sad, to-night, Christie," said Uncle Reuben,
forcing a smile, "thee must be cheerful, thee knows.
Where is Bertha?"
</p>

<p>
"She went out more than an hour ago," replied Christie,
"to ramble in the woods, according to her usual
habit.  I hope she will return before the storm rises!"
</p>

<p>
"The storm will be on us in half an hour," said Uncle
Reuben, looking uneasily at the darkened sky; "and, as
thee knows, a storm always rouses Bertha into a state of
wildness bordering on frenzy, and sends her rambling off
in all directions.  I had better go and look for her."
</p>

<p>
"Where is the use, Uncle Reuben?" said Christie,
seating herself languidly in her rocking-chair.  "You
often went in search of her before, and hardly ever found
her until she chose to come home herself, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but one does not feel so uneasy when searching
for her, as sitting here in the house while she is
exposed to the storm.  However, I'll wait and get the
supper, and if she is not here then, I will go and look for
her," said Uncle Reuben, as he proceeded to light the fire
and hang on the kettle.
</p>

<p>
The night deepened and darkened, the sky grew
blacker and gloomier, the moments waned rapidly, but
the maniac Bertha came not.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wish she were here!" anxiously said good
Uncle Reuben, opening the door and looking out into
the gloom.  A wailing gust of wind from the dark forest,
followed by a vivid flash of lightning and flood of rain,
made him hastily re-enter and close the door.
</p>

<p>
"And she is exposed to it all!" he exclaimed, in
deepest trouble.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she will soon come, I know she will," said Christie,
hopefully.
</p>

<p>
But still the moments glided away, the lonesome night
lingered and lingered, and the maniac came not.
</p>

<p>
"I must go and seek for her," said Uncle Reuben, at
last, in desperation, as he took down his great-coat and
buttoned it on, and started for the door.
</p>

<p>
But just at that instant it was burst violently open,
and the woman Bertha, with streaming hair and dripping
garments, her wild, black eyes dilating with terror, stood
panting before them.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Bertha, where has thee been?" cried Uncle Reuben,
in distress and alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Hush! he is there!" said the maniac, in a terrified
whisper.  "They killed him and left him in the forest;
but I found him!  Come, come, come!"
</p>

<p>
She caught Reuben by the hand, and attempted to
draw him with her from the house.
</p>

<p>
"Who is killed?  I don't know what thee means,
Bertha," he said, perplexed.
</p>

<p>
"Come, I tell you&mdash;he is there!" she cried, with an
impatient stamp of her foot, "out among the trees where
they left him.  Come!"
</p>

<p>
And, with the grasp of steel, she caught the surprised
Reuben by the arm, and forcibly drew him with her from
the house.
</p>

<p>
Left alone, Christie, somewhat amazed at first, soon
forgot the circumstance, and gazing into the expiring
coals, listened to the wild ravings of the storm, as it
raged through the forest, with that lulling sense of
security one falls into when comfortably housed.  There were
strange pictures in the red, dying embers, to her that
night&mdash;faces lost to her forever peering out in fitful
flame&mdash;now Willard's, now the dark, threatening one of
handsome Sibyl Campbell, now the brisk, sharp, cheery
countenance of Mrs. Tom, all fading, one after another,
to give place once more to Willard's, best loved of all.
</p>

<p>
The night was wearing on apace&mdash;the last glowing
ember had faded away in darkness; and, rousing herself
from her dreamy reverie, as an unusually violent gust of
wind shook the doors and windows, Christie raised her
head, wondering uneasily what could have detained
Uncle Reuben.
</p>

<p>
Just as she was beginning to get seriously anxious,
the door was impetuously thrown open, and Bertha
entered, followed by Uncle Reuben, bearing in his herculean
arms the seemingly lifeless form of a man.  Christie
sprang up, and stood gazing from one to another, in terror.
</p>

<p>
"There!" said Uncle Reuben, placing the rigid form
on the bed in the corner, and wiping the perspiration off
his brow, "I had some trouble, strong as I am, in carrying
him so far, through all this storm.  She led me to the
very spot," he said, with a sort of triumph, as he looked
at Bertha; "and I found him lying bleeding and
senseless on the ground."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" said Christie, for, with the dark hair
falling over the blood-clotted face, the features were
undistinguishable.
</p>

<p>
"That, I do not know, but some traveler, I imagine,
who has been thrown from his horse, judging from the
looks of his wounds.  Get me some warm water and a
sponge until I wash the blood off his face."
</p>

<p>
As Christie obeyed, something in the wounded
stranger struck her, and with a sudden thrill she leaned
against the wall and pressed her hands to her panting
heart.  Not perceiving her emotion, the man Reuben
reverently lifted the dark, heavy masses of hair, and
wiped the blood off his pale, handsome face.  As if
fascinated, Christie's eyes were fixed on those cold, rigid
features, every one of which was indelibly imprinted on
her heart; her eyes dilating, her lips parted, and breathless;
her face deadly pale; her heart beating as tumultuously
as though it would break from its prison and force
its way to him.  With a cry that resounded through the
house&mdash;a cry that made even the maniac Bertha start in
terror, she sprang forward, and clasped the cold form in
her arms with a wild and passionate shriek.
</p>

<p>
"Willard!  Willard!" she exclaimed, "Oh, Father in
heaven!  Willard!"
</p>

<p>
Transfixed with amazement, Reuben stood gazing
upon her, unable to speak, while, with a hysterical laugh,
she covered the cold, marble-like face with hot, burning,
passionate kisses, still crying out at intervals that loved
name.
</p>

<p>
"Willard!  Willard!  Willard!"
</p>

<p>
"So thee knows him, Christie?" said Uncle Reuben,
as last, in a voice of intense astonishment.
</p>

<p>
She looked up, with another hysterical laugh, and
then overtaxed nature gave way to a burst of blessed,
soothing tears.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am surprised!" slowly said Uncle Reuben.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Uncle Reuben, he is my husband!" said Christie,
in a voice choked with vehement sobs.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Thy husband!</i>" said Uncle Reuben, in a tone that
plainly bespoke his fears that Christie had lost her reason.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes, yes, my husband! my long-lost husband! whom
I never expected to meet again on this side of the
grave.  Oh, Uncle Reuben, you did not know I was
married, but so it is!  I never meant to tell you, but the
surprise&mdash;the shock&mdash;forced it from me.  Oh, Uncle
Reuben, do not look as if you thought me insane; for
indeed, indeed, I speak the truth."  And again Christie's
voice was lost in sobs, as she bowed her head on the cold
breast before her, and thought how warmly and
tumultuously it had once throbbed for her.
</p>

<p>
Uncle Reuben was not one to give way long to any
emotion; so, with a look of intense surprise and perplexity,
he recalled his scattered faculties, and once more
approaching the bed, said, slowly:
</p>

<p>
"Well, if he <i>is</i> thy husband, thee is anxious, no doubt,
for his recovery, and had better go away for the present,
and let me attend to him and bring him to."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Uncle Reuben, do you think he is dead?" said
Christie, in a tone of piercing anguish.
</p>

<p>
"By no means, little one; he is only in a swoon at
present, from which he will shortly recover.  And there
are no bones broken, either," added Uncle Reuben, after
a short examination, "only this ugly cut in his head,
which has bled so profusely, and which I must bind up
now.  We'll have to cut the hair off just round the
temple, you see, to get at it.  It's Heaven's mercy it
wasn't half an inch lower, or he would have been a dead
man now."
</p>

<p>
A convulsive shudder at the bare idea agitated the
slender form of Christie; and she lifted the silky waves
of dark hair with a fond superstition as they were
severed, all matted with blood, from his head.
</p>

<p>
And thus, while Uncle Reuben sat down to bathe his
temple and forehead with water, she took the cold hands
in her own burning ones to chafe them, with her eyes
still fixed, as if she could never remove them more, on
that cold, white, handsome face, as still and fixed as
though immovable in death, looking whiter still in
contrast with the wet black hair.
</p>

<p>
"And so thee is a wife, little Christie," said Uncle
Reuben, looking thoughtfully and wonderingly upon the
two faces before him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, yes! forgive me for not telling you before;
but it was a secret.  No one knew of it; we were married
in private."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, those hidden marriages never come to any
good," said Uncle Reuben, as he shook his head and
glanced at Bertha, who all this time had been standing at
the foot of the bed, gazing with a sort of vague interest
and curiosity from one face to the other.  "What if her
fate had been thine?"
</p>

<p>
"It has scarcely been more happy," said Christie,
without lifting her eyes; "but this moment, to see him
once more, to touch his hand, to know I am near him
again, almost repays me for all I have suffered.  Now, at
least, I can die happy, since I have the opportunity of
telling him I forgive him all."
</p>

<p>
"Forgive him!  Then he has wronged thee?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" said Christie, turning, if possible, paler than
before.  "He loved me once, and I wish to forget everything
but that.  But, Uncle Reuben, are you sure he will
recover?  I see no signs of it yet," said Christie, in rising
alarm.
</p>

<p>
"I do; even now consciousness is returning," said
Uncle Reuben, as a slight movement of the muscles of
the face became perceptible.
</p>

<p>
"Willard!  Willard! dearest Willard, look up!" she
said, bending anxiously over him.
</p>

<p>
Was it the startling sound of that well-remembered
voice&mdash;that voice he imagined forever stilled in
death&mdash;that awoke him?  The large dark eyes slowly opened,
wandered wildly around, and the first object on which
they rested was Christie.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br><br>
EXPLANATIONS.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Mine after life!  What is mine after life?<br>
  My day is closed!  The gloom of night is come!<br>
  A hopeless darkness settles o'er my fate."&mdash;JOANNA BAILLIE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Willard!  Willard!  Willard!"
</p>

<p>
With his own name breathed in his ears by
the voice he never expected to hear again;
with the small, fair face, the deep blue eyes, and waving
golden hair of Christie bending over him, Willard
Drummond lay scarcely daring to breathe, unable to speak,
gazing with wild, wondering, incredulous eyes upon the
angel-face he had never expected to behold on earth more.
</p>

<p>
"Willard!  Willard!  My own Willard!  Only say
you know me! only speak to me once more before I die!"
was the wild cry that sighed in his ear in the tones of that
never-to-be-forgotten voice.
</p>

<p>
He pressed his hands to his forehead, like one in a
dream.
</p>

<p>
"Am I mad?" he said, slowly; "or am I dead, and
see Christie again in the world of spirits?"
</p>

<p>
"Willard!  Willard! we both live!  Oh, Willard, thank
Heaven you were spared the guilt of my death!  Oh,
Willard!  I am not dead; do not, <i>do not</i> look at me so
wildly!"
</p>

<p>
"Can this be only the delirium of a dream?" he said,
passing his hand over his brow, in the same troubled and
bewildered way.
</p>

<p>
No, it was not a dream!  No phantom of the
imagination ever could have clasped him with such yearning,
clinging arms; ever could have held his head on such a
warm, throbbing breast; ever could have looked into his
face with such passionate, undying love; ever could have
showered upon him such passionate caresses.
</p>

<p>
He awoke to the reality at last.  Springing up in bed
where he lay, he gazed upon her as if doubting the
evidence of his senses.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard!  Oh, my husband!  I am not dead; I
was only wounded!  I live still to say I forgive you all
that is past!"
</p>

<p>
"Great Heaven! am I sane or mad?" he said, in a low,
deep, wondering voice.
</p>

<p>
She approached, caught both his hands in hers, and
kneeling down before him, said:
</p>

<p>
"Willard, look at me! feel my hands! my face!
Listen to my words! see me kneeling before you! and
believe I am your own faithful, loving Christie still!"
</p>

<p>
"Then <i>she</i> may be saved yet!" was his wild cry, as
unheeding the slender girl kneeling at his feet, he sprang
from the bed, with the one thought of Sibyl ever, ever
uppermost in his mind.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Who</i>, Willard?"
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl!  Sibyl! my wronged Sibyl!"
</p>

<p>
At the words, at the name, her blissful dream faded
away.  The past, the dreary, wretched past came back,
and Christie's head dropped heavily on the bed.
</p>

<p>
He was scarcely in his right senses yet, but the action,
and, above all, the necessity of haste restored him to
himself; and stunned, bewildered, giddy with many
emotions, he sank into a chair and strove to collect his
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"I know not yet whether I am sleeping or waking,"
he said, incoherently.  "Christie&mdash;where are you?  Come
here; let me see you again, that I may know whether all
this is not a vision of a disordered brain, that will fade
away as many a similar one has done."
</p>

<p>
She arose, and with a face as perfectly colorless as a
snow-wreath, stood before him.
</p>

<p>
He took her hand, so small, and warm, and transparent
that it looked like an infant's; and pushing back the
full golden hair off the fine white brow, gazed long and
earnestly into the depths of the large blue eyes, now so
unspeakably sad, so deeply reproachful.  So long did he
gaze that Christie's eyes fell at last, and the golden lashes
swept her cheek, while the eloquent blood mantled for a
moment to her snowy brow.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, this is Christie&mdash;alive still, and yet so long
mourned for as dead," he said slowly.  "This is strange;
this is wonderful.  Christie, how comes this to pass?
How is it that, after so many months given up for dead, I
find you alive still in this forest cottage?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard, Willard! can <i>you</i> ask, after that dreadful
night?" she said, in a tone of unutterable sorrow and
reproach.
</p>

<p>
"That dreadful night?  <i>What</i> dreadful night, Christie?"
he said, looking bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard, what a question for you to ask!  That
you could ever for one instant forget that night of storm
and crime!"
</p>

<p>
"Christie, as Heaven hears me, I know not what you
mean.  Do you allude to that tempestuous night on
which you were supposed to be murdered?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know I do!  You know I do!  Oh, Willard,
Willard! that <i>you</i> should speak of it like this!" she
said, in that low tone of saddest reproach.
</p>

<p>
"Christie, there is some misunderstanding here.  Do
you mean to say that <i>I</i> was with you that night?" he said,
vehemently.
</p>

<p>
She did not reply, but her eyes answered the question.
</p>

<p>
"Christie, as there is a Heaven above us, I never set
foot on the island from the day we parted there after
your telling me of your interview with Sibyl!" said
Willard, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
"And the note?" she said, faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean the note appointing our meeting on
the beach that night of mystery?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, yes!"
</p>

<p>
"Christie, I sent that note, but I never went&mdash;<i>never</i>!
I swear it by all that is sacred!  That very hour I
received news that my father was dying, which obliged
me to start instantly for home, without even an opportunity
of apprising you.  Christie, that night I spent fifty
miles away from the island."
</p>

<p>
She gasped for breath, grew deadly pale, and sank
into a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Christie, Christie! do you not believe me?"
</p>

<p>
She lifted her eyes.  There was truth in his face; and,
with the wild flash of sudden joy, she cried out:
</p>

<p>
"I do!  I do!  I do!  Oh, Willard, thank Heaven
for this!  Thank Heaven that you never raised your
hand against my life!"
</p>

<p>
"Christie!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do not wonder at your look of horror; but, all
those weary months, I thought so.  Oh, Willard, dearest,
can you ever forgive me for wronging you so?"
</p>

<p>
"Christie!"
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me! forgive me!  Oh, my husband, forgive
me!  But on that night, that awful night, I was met on
the beach and stabbed by a man."
</p>

<p>
"Heavens and earth!  And you thought it was I?"
</p>

<p>
"Willard, Willard, forgive me!  But oh! what else
<i>could</i> I think?  <i>You</i> appointed the meeting.  I went, was
met there by a tall man, stabbed by him, and left for
dead on the shore."
</p>

<p>
"And you could believe <i>I</i> could do such a deed!  Oh,
Christie, Christie!" he said, with bitter reproach.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how could I help it?  How could I help it?
The thought was maddening: but how could I think
otherwise?  Say, only say, you forgive me, Willard!"
</p>

<p>
"I forgive you, Christie; but you have far the most
to forgive.  What strange, fathomless mystery all this is?
Who was the man, Christie?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know!  I have no idea!  Oh, I thought I
had not an enemy in the wild world."
</p>

<p>
"Is there no clew?  Is there no means by which you
could recognize him again?"
</p>

<p>
"None! none! you forget the storm; the darkness:
the deep darkness of that night."
</p>

<p>
"True! but heavens! what am I thinking of!" he
said, starting up wildly.  "Why do I linger an instant
here, when it is in my power to save Sibyl from the
ignominious death of the halter."
</p>

<p>
"What!"
</p>

<p>
As if a mine had exploded beneath her, Christie
sprang up, with blanched face, starting eyes, clenched
hands, and livid lips, gazing upon him in speechless
horror.
</p>

<p>
"Christie, she was arrested, tried, condemned, and
doomed to die, for your murder."
</p>

<p>
"For mine!  Father in heaven!" gasped the almost
fainting Christie.
</p>

<p>
"It may not be too late to save her yet.  You must
come with me, Christie.  Hasten! hasten!  Every
moment is precious now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this is awful! awful!  Oh, Willard, when does
this most unnatural sentence take place?"
</p>

<p>
"The day after to-morrow.  With all our speed we will
be barely able to reach the spot in time."
</p>

<p>
"Most horrible!" said Christie, with a convulsive
shudder.  "How came she ever to be suspected of such a
deed?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there was a damning chain of circumstantial
evidence, strong enough to convict an angel from above.
I have no time to tell you now; on our way I will tell
you all.  Merciful Heaven! if we should be too late."
</p>

<p>
"I will go instantly!  I will be ready in a moment."
said Christie, wildly, as she hurriedly threw on her
wrappings.
</p>

<p>
"But not in this storm, Christie.  Does thee not hear
how it rages?" anxiously said Uncle Reuben, who all this
time had been a silent, wondering listener.  "Thee must
not venture out to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I must!  I must! the life of a fellow-creature
depends upon it," said Christie, tying on her large mantle
with trembling haste.
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond paused for a moment in dismay,
to listen to the storm howling through the trees, and
glance at the frail, fragile little figure before him.  But
the thought of Sibyl in peril&mdash;of that dreadful
death&mdash;steeled his heart against every other feeling.
</p>

<p>
"She must be saved, let what will follow," he
mentally exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Thee will never be able to make thy way through
this storm, Christie," said Reuben, rising in still increasing
anxiety; "in thy delicate state of health, too.  Listen
to the wind and rain."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I hear it!  I hear it!  But though it rained fire
from heaven, I should have to go."
</p>

<p>
"Thee will never survive this night, if thee ventures
out," said Uncle Reuben, solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"What matters it?  My life is worthless, so hers is
saved," she said, with sorrowful bitterness.
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond's heart smote him; and some of
the old love revived in his heart that moment for poor
Christie.
</p>

<p>
"Christie, thee will perish with fatigue."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; I'll not.  This inward strength will sustain
me.  I will live, I must live, I shall live, to save Sibyl
Campbell.  I feel it; an inward voice tells me so."
</p>

<p>
"Then thee is determined to go?" said Uncle Reuben,
sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"I must.  Duty calls me.  Dear Uncle Reuben, good-by."
</p>

<p>
"Will thee ever come back, little Christie?" he said,
holding the little hand she extended in both his.
</p>

<p>
"As Heaven wills!  I fear not.  But&mdash;Uncle Reuben&mdash;dear,
good, Uncle Reuben&mdash;if I do not, you will come
to see me die?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dearest Christie!" his honest voice choked, and
he stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, Bertha.  Kiss Christie once more."
</p>

<p>
She put her arms round the neck of the maniac, whose
eyes were fixed wistfully on her face.  "Going away?"
she said, in a tone of vague surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dearest friend; and if I never come back, you
must not quite forget me."
</p>

<p>
"Christie!  Christie! my wife! my injured, long-suffering
wife, do not talk so!  I cannot bear it!" said
Willard Drummond, passionately; for every word of that
sorrowful parting had been like a dagger to his heart.
</p>

<p>
She came over with the old, trusting love of happier
times, when that love first filled her heart, and clasping
her hands on his shoulder, she dropped her face on his
breast, and softly murmured:
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Willard! it is better so.  I am not afraid to
die now, after what I have heard to-night.  And&mdash;do not
be hurt, dearest love&mdash;but I have no wish to live.  You
will be happy with her&mdash;with Sibyl; and I&mdash;I will pray
for you both, and love you both in heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Christie! oh, my wife!" he cried, clasping her in
his arms, with a passionate cry; "am I only to realize
the treasure I have lost when it is too late."
</p>

<p>
"Not too late, Willard; if it will help to make you a
better, a holier man, it is not too late.  There are many
happy days for you, for Sibyl, for me&mdash;yet to come."
</p>

<p>
"Wretch, wretch, that I have been!" he groaned, in
bitter grief.  "Why was I doomed to bring misery and
death on all who ever loved me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard, hush!  You break my heart!" said
Christie, lifting her golden head off his breast.  "You
must not talk in that wild way.  And we are losing time
staying here, when every second is more precious than
untold gold," she added, starting up.  "Come, Willard,
come."
</p>

<p>
While she spoke, Uncle Reuben, who had passed out
unobserved, re-entered.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, once more, Uncle Reuben," said Christie,
"we are going."
</p>

<p>
"Not 'good-by' yet, little Christie.  I will go with
thee to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, Uncle Reuben, there is no necessity.  I know
the way."
</p>

<p>
"And did thee think, little one, I was going to let thee
walk that distance in this pelting storm?" said Uncle
Reuben, with a sad, grave smile.  "No; it is not quite
so bad as that.  Thee will ride in the donkey-cart until
we reach&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then you have such a conveyance?" said Willard,
eagerly.  "Thank Heaven for that!  In it you will at
least be saved the fatigue of walking, Christie."
</p>

<p>
"But how can you leave Bertha, Uncle Reuben?"
</p>

<p>
"I will lock the door, and Bertha will go to bed&mdash;will
thee not, Bertha?"
</p>

<p>
The maniac nodded, and still wistfully watched Christie,
as though some faint impression that she was going
to lose her was forcing its way through her clouded
brain.
</p>

<p>
For the first time, Willard turned his eyes upon her,
and gave a violent start, as he recognized the well-known
spectral face.
</p>

<p>
"Who is she?" he asked, in breathless surprise.
</p>

<p>
In a few brief words, Christie gave him to understand
how it had happened he had seen her on the isle.
</p>

<p>
And then, drawing her arm within his, Willard led her
from the house, followed by Uncle Reuben.
</p>

<p>
Christie took her place in the humble little donkey-cart,
and cowered down to avoid the pelting rain.
</p>

<p>
"Thee had better get in, too, being wounded and weak
from loss of blood," said Uncle Reuben to Willard.  "I
will walk and drive."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  Do you imagine I would ride while you
walked?  I am not so weak; I feel the strength of ten
men within me, urging me on."
</p>

<p>
"That is only excitement, friend; it will not last.
Thee had better get in."
</p>

<p>
But Willard peremptorily refused, and took his place
on the other side of the little cart.
</p>

<p>
Seeing it was in vain to urge him, the old man allowed
the animal to start.  And Christie raised for a moment
her bowed head, to cast one last, sorrowful glance at
the little, isolated, forest cottage she was never destined to
see again.  They turned an abrupt angle, the night and
darkness shut it from her view, and with a long,
shivering sigh, she bent her head once more on her pale
hands.
</p>

<p>
The night-ride through the forest&mdash;with the wind
wailing eerily in long, lamentable blasts through the
waving arms of the trees, with the rain driving in blinding
gusts in their faces, with the pall of an almost Egyptian
darkness around, above, and on every hand!  That
night-ride! sleeping or waking, in after days, alone or in the
gayest assembly, it would rise like a haunting vision
before the eyes of Willard Drummond; and the little,
bowed, shadowy figure crouching silently in a corner of
the wagon, would awaken in his heart feelings of
undying remorse.  That night-ride, through the long,
lonesome woods!  All the great wrong he had done that
little, bowed form, from whose gentle lips no word of
reproach ever fell, from whose loving eyes no accusing
glance ever flashed, arose in bitter array before him, until
he felt as if he could never encounter the gaze of those
earnest, soul-lit orbs again&mdash;felt, as he walked beside her,
as much out of his sphere as a lost soul might feel before
the gates of heaven.
</p>

<p>
Then, by a natural transition, his thoughts were
straying out to the future&mdash;to Sibyl.  She was lost to him
now, as much as though she were dead and in her grave.
There was a sharp, keen pang piercing through his heart
for one moment, at the thought; the next, a more generous
feeling filled it, and he felt as if he could even
joyfully give her up, to save her from that awful doom.
Once Sibyl was saved, his determination was to depart
with his little, drooping girl-wife, to some far-off
Southern clime&mdash;to some sunny village in France, or Italy,
where the more genial climate would restore her to
health, and where the wretched past would be forever
unknown.  There, he would endeavor to atone, by his
devoted care and attention, for all he had ever made her
suffer, and forget Sibyl.  But that name, as usual, woke
a host of tender, sorrowful memories, and something
akin to despair again replaced every other feeling in his
tortured mind.  Truly, in the keen suffering of that
moment, he realized what Divine retribution is.
</p>

<p>
And so on&mdash;still on, through the chill, bleak night, the
driving, splashing rain, the sighing, moaning wind, the
dark, desolate forest-road, our weary, silent trio wound
their lonely way.  Not a word was spoken from the
moment of starting.
</p>

<p>
Christie bowed, collapsed, shuddering, cowered in the
bottom of the rude cart, her white, thin face hidden in
her whiter, thinner hands.  Uncle Reuben, urging on the
stumbling donkey to his utmost speed, and now and then
turning to see that "Little Christie" was safe, or to
glance at the tall, dark figure walking opposite.  And
Willard Drummond, with his hat drawn down over his
brows, muffled in his cloak, strode on, with bowed head,
too absorbed in his own bitter thoughts to heed the flight
of time.
</p>

<p>
And so the long, silent night lingered and lingered,
and the dripping forest-road was passed at last; and they
passed, at intervals, gloomy-looking farm-houses, whose
inmates were still asleep, and whose only greeting to our
weary travelers was the noisy barking of their watchdogs
as they passed on.
</p>

<p>
And so the melancholy journey was continued until
morning, wan, cold and gray, lifted its dead, dull face
from the mantle of night, and cast a sickly glimmer of
light along the wet, slippery path.
</p>

<p>
"Morning at last," said Uncle Reuben, lifting his
head, with a deep sigh of relief.  "This has been the
longest night I have ever known."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, morning," said Willard Drummond, looking up
bitterly at the dull, leaden sky; "and we so far from
Westport yet; Only one day more between her and an
ignominious death."
</p>

<p>
Uncle Reuben looked at him a moment, and then at
the bowed form in the cart, with a look of calm reproach.
</p>

<p>
"Is thee tired, Christie?" he said, approaching her.
</p>

<p>
She lifted her head, disclosing a face so white and
haggard, so worn with fatigue, sleeplessness, and grief,
that even Willard started back in sorrow and alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, little Christie!  I knew this journey would kill
thee!" said Uncle Reuben, with a groan.
</p>

<p>
"I feel a little tired, that is all," she said, forcing a
wan smile.  "Dear friend, do not look at me with such
frightened, anxious eyes; it is nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Thee is deadly pale, Christie."
</p>

<p>
"I am cold," she said, with a shiver; "nothing more."
</p>

<p>
"And wet through," said Uncle Reuben, sorrowfully.
"We must stop at the first house we meet, and get some
dry clothes, and some breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"No, no; you must not stop; there is no time to lose.
Pray, go on," said Christie, in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Thee must take time," said Uncle Reuben, firmly,
looking straight at Willard.  "Thee will hardly live to
see Westport, else.  Does thee want to die a suicide,
Christie?"
</p>

<p>
"He speaks truly, dearest&mdash;we must stop at the nearest
farm-house," said Willard, bending over her.  "My
poor Christie, you do indeed look jaded to death," he
added, sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"It is nothing, Willard.  If I only reach Westport in
time, I care for nothing else."
</p>

<p>
"But I do, Christie.  I want you after that to hurry
and get well, and come with me to Italy, to far-off,
beautiful Italy, where our lives will be happy as a
fairy-tale."
</p>

<p>
She lifted her large, lustrous blue eyes to his face, with
along, steady gaze&mdash;the calm, far-seeing gaze of a soul
lingering on the verge of eternity.  How plainly those
mournful eyes said "Too late! too late!"  But she did
not speak; she only smiled faintly, and then sank
wearily back, with her head shrouded in her mantle once
more.
</p>

<p>
The white hands of morning were now fast pushing
aside the clouds of night.  As they went on they encountered
one or two laborers, with spades on their shoulders,
going to their daily toil, who stared at them with
lackluster eyes, as if they thought them ghosts.  At the end
of half an hour they reached a comfortable-looking
farmhouse, and alighted at the outer gate.  Willard lifted
Christie out in his arms, while Uncle Reuben, with his
whip, kept off the dogs that ran out, barking loudly.  The
noise brought the farmer himself to the door, who, noticing
the drooping form of Christie, and the pale, worn
face of her companions, cordially invited them to enter.
</p>

<p>
There was a bright, cheerful fire blazing on the ample
hearth, and a woman bending over it, preparing breakfast.
As she placed a chair for Christie, into which the
young girl dropped, totally exhausted, Willard drew her
aside, and placing his purse in her hands said:
</p>

<p>
"My good woman, you perceive the young lady's
clothes are wet through.  Will you be good enough to
take her to your room, and furnish her with some dry
ones?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I'm sure I'll be glad to help her, poor young
thing!  I've got some will jest about fit her," said the
woman, with a sympathizing look.
</p>

<p>
Willard whispered a few words in the ear of Christie,
who arose and followed the woman from the room, while
a girl about Christie's size took charge of the breakfast.
Willard seated himself near the fire, and fell once more
into a painful reverie, from which the return of Christie
aroused him.  He placed a chair for her beside his own,
and sinking into it she dropped her weary little head on
his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast was soon smoking on the table, and the
three wayfarers took seats; but much as they needed
food, this errand had effectually taken away their appetites,
and it was with the utmost difficulty they could prevail
upon Christie even to swallow a cup of coffee.
</p>

<p>
"Can you furnish me with a horse and wagon to
reach N&mdash;&mdash;?" said Willard to their host, as they arose
from the table.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you can come with me," replied the man.  "I'm
going there myself in an hour."
</p>

<p>
"What time will you be in N&mdash;&mdash;?" said Willard,
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Little after noon."
</p>

<p>
"And if we take fresh horses immediately we can
reach Westport before morning, can we not?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, very easily; travel all night, and you'll be
there in the morning.  S'pose you're going, with
everybody else, to see the woman executed, eh?  Lord bless
me! what's the matter with her?" said the man, in dismay,
as Christie, with a loud, indescribable cry, hid her
face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing! nothing!" said Willard, and with a face
perfectly colorless.  "What time&mdash;at what hour, I mean,
does this execution take place?"
</p>

<p>
"Nine in the morning; has to be early on account of
the mob.  Nobody ever heard tell of such a mass of
people as will be there.  Most as many as at the Day of
Judgment."
</p>

<p>
"Can you not start right away?"
</p>

<p>
"No, couldn't before an hour."
</p>

<p>
"Is there any other conveyance to be hired near?"
</p>

<p>
"No, there ain't," said the man, shortly; "everybody
wants their own to take themselves there.  If it's to see
her hung you want, you'll be plenty time when I start."
</p>

<p>
There was no help for it; and Willard and his equally
impatient companions were obliged to wait almost two
hours before the farmer was ready to start.  Then he and
his wife mounted on the front seat, and Willard and
Christie sat behind, and throwing her arms around his
neck, Christie bade Uncle Reuben a last farewell.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, little Christie!" he said, sorrowfully,
"Good-by, and Heaven bless thee.  I will come to see
thee some day soon."
</p>

<p>
And then good Uncle Reuben entered his donkey-cart,
and turned his sad face toward the lonesome forest
cottage, doubly lonesome now.  And Christie, shrinking
closer to Willard, laid her tired head on his arm, too
weary and exhausted even to weep for the friend she had
left.
</p>

<p>
The farmer, who had no intention of injuring his
horse by fast driving, went plodding at a jog-trot
onward, in spite of Willard's furious demands to drive
fast.  Inwardly cursing the lazy beast, he gave up the
effort at last, and strove to while away the tedious hours
in conversing with Christie.
</p>

<p>
Slowly and somewhat incoherently he learned from
her all the events of that night, and of her after life in
the cottage, and her motives for remaining there.
</p>

<p>
"And you were willing to remain in that isolated
place all your life that I might marry Sibyl Campbell,
my poor Christie!" he said, with a pang of deepest
remorse.  "And so you loved me still, even believing me
guilty?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard! did you think for one moment that I
could cease to love you?" she answered, fervently.  "It
was because I loved you so well that I wished to see you
happy with Sibyl."
</p>

<p>
"My faithful, leal-hearted, unselfish little wife," he
groaned, pressing her closer to his side.
</p>

<p>
"But, Willard, there is one thing I want to know.  I
want to hear it from your own lips.  Answer me truly,
as you hope for salvation, <i>do you love Sibyl Campbell</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Christie, I do!  I do!  Better than life, better
than my soul's salvation?  Better than my hopes of
heaven do I love her!" he exclaimed, passionately.
</p>

<p>
"It is well," she said, folding her hands, with a slight
shiver.  "Thank Heaven for the boon of death."
</p>

<p>
"But, Christie, I will forget her; you are my wife.  I
will go far away, where I will never see her more!" he
said, recalled to himself.  "By devoting my life to you, I
will try to atone for all I have made you suffer, sweet
wife."
</p>

<p>
"It will not be necessary, Willard.  Dearest, best
Willard, can you not see I am dying?"
</p>

<p>
"Christie!" he cried out in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"I mean that my days are numbered; and, Willard,
I am happy.  I only wish for life long enough to save
Sibyl."
</p>

<p>
Something in her tone checked the words he was
going to say, and both relapsed into silence, broken at
last by her saying:
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all that has happened to you and to my
friends, since that night."
</p>

<p>
And then he began, and related all; his father's
death; the shock he received on hearing of her murder;
of his departure for Europe with the Campbells; of their
return and their marriage.  At this point he could feel a
slight shudder run through the frame of Christie; but
when he spoke of the unlooked-for interruption, and of
Sibyl's being carried off to prison, and of her condemnation,
she trembled so convulsively that he was forced to
stop.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, poor Sibyl!" she said, passionately.  "Oh,
Willard! her fate was far worse than mine.  What is
suffering of any kind compared with the shame&mdash;the
overwhelming disgrace&mdash;of that trial, exposed to the
merciless eyes of the hundreds?  And that I should, in any
way, be the cause!  Oh, Willard! it is dreadful!"
</p>

<p>
She wept, so violently that he was alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"My own dear Christie, be calm," he said, soothingly.
"Consider that you are now going to save her life."
</p>

<p>
Still she wept on, until her overcharged heart was
relieved; and then, worn out in mind and body, she fell
fast asleep on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Early in the afternoon they reached N&mdash;&mdash;, which
they found crowded with strangers on their way to
Westport.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Christie in a hotel, Willard went to seek for
a fast horse to take them to town; but, to his dismay, he
found that every vehicle in the village was already
engaged.  Nearly insane with wild impatience, he offered
enormous sums for a horse; but as the stern "Impossible!"
rose against all his demands, he was forced to
return to the hotel in a state bordering on frenzy, and
offer the farmer with whom they had come the price of a
dozen horses if he would only consent to surrender the
wagon to him and let him drive.
</p>

<p>
Carried away by the young man's distracted words
and manner, he at last consented; and causing Christie
to be wrapped up in a large, warm shawl to protect her
from the night air, he lifted her into the wagon, took his
seat beside her, and dashed off at a break-neck pace.
</p>

<p>
Not a word was spoken, as Willard, urging the animal
to its utmost speed, almost flew over the ground.  The
few remaining hours of daylight passed, and night fell
dark and starless.  On, still on, he urged the reeking,
foaming, panting beast.  They were still far from
Westport&mdash;scarcely more than half way&mdash;and the short night
would soon be gone.  Each time the tired animal would
halt, panting for a moment, the vision of Sibyl, in her
prison-cell waiting for death, would rise before him,
until, nearly mad with impatience, he would mercilessly
lash the poor brute on to greater speed.
</p>

<p>
But, just as he was beginning to hope that the rate at
which they were going would, in two or three hours,
bring them to Westport, the animal, completely exhausted,
dropped to the ground, unable to proceed another step.
</p>

<p>
With a furious imprecation, Willard sprang out and
strove to assist him to his feet, but in vain.  The horse
was totally unable even to rise.
</p>

<p>
For one moment Willard leaned against the wagon,
while a feeling of utter despair filled his heart.  The
distance from Westport&mdash;the few intervening hours&mdash;the
impossibility of procuring another horse&mdash;the awful
peril of Sibyl, struck a chill, like that of death to his
heart.
</p>

<p>
"All is lost, Christie&mdash;all is lost!" he said, in a voice
so altered that she scarcely knew it.  "The horse is
driven to death, and in ten short hours Sibyl dies!"
</p>

<p>
"Heaven help us!" said Christie, wringing her pale
hands.  "Willard, we must walk."
</p>

<p>
"Walk!" he repeated, bitterly.  "Before the end of
the first mile your fate would be similar to his."  And he
touched the animal with his foot.
</p>

<p>
"Try me&mdash;try me!" said Christie, springing from her
seat.  "Heaven will give me strength in this hour.  Oh,
Willard, hasten!"
</p>

<p>
With a speed as great as it was unnatural, Christie
started forward; and Willard, with a last despairing
effort, accompanied her, expecting every moment to see
her fictitious strength give way.  But no! it was as if a
new spirit had entered that slight frame&mdash;for as she
never could have walked in her days of perfect health
and strength, she walked now; never for one moment
faltering, until the first dawn of morning grew red in the
sky.  But with its first blush Willard felt the faint hope
that had hitherto buoyed him up die entirely away.
Walk as they might, he felt it would be high noon before
they could reach Westport.
</p>

<p>
"It is all useless, Christie," he said, pausing abruptly.
"It is no use trying&mdash;we can never save her!"
</p>

<p>
"We will save her&mdash;we shall save her!" exclaimed
Christie, with a strange kind of exultation.  "Hark!"
she added, "do you not hear a carriage approaching?"
</p>

<p>
Even as she spoke, a cloud of dust arose, and the
thunder of wheels was heard rapidly approaching.
</p>

<p>
"Saved!" she cried, joyfully.  "Praised be God!"
</p>

<p>
Willard sprang forward to intercept the driver, and
saw a large country wagon nearly filled with people.
</p>

<p>
"Can you take us to Westport?  Our errand is one of
life and death!"
</p>

<p>
Something in Willard's tone startled the man; but
after a moment's stare, he replied:
</p>

<p>
"Yes; jump in."
</p>

<p>
Lifting Christie in first, he took his seat beside her,
and again dashed off.
</p>

<p>
"Hasten&mdash;hasten! for the love of Heaven!" cried
Willard, passionately.
</p>

<p>
"I'll do my best," said the man.  "I want to be in
time for the execution, anyway."
</p>

<p>
On they fled.  Mile after mile was passed; but, to the
excited mind of Willard, they seemed going at a snail's
pace.  Did the sun ever rise so rapidly any morning
before as it did on that?  Eight o'clock, and still ten
miles from Westport.
</p>

<p>
"Faster&mdash;faster!  A thousand&mdash;two thousand&mdash;three
thousand dollars, if we only reach Westport before nine,"
shouted Willard, almost maddened.  "A human life
depends on it&mdash;I have a reprieve."
</p>

<p>
"Hooray!" shouted the boy who drove.  "If ever
Sultan went, he'll have to go it now.  Here's my stick;
tie your handkerchief on it, to hoist when we get into the
town, and they'll stop the execution."
</p>

<p>
Lashing his horse until the perspiration stood in great
beads on his forehead, away they flew, and ten minutes
before nine rushed furiously into the town.
</p>

<p>
The streets were crowded&mdash;blocked up with people&mdash;a
boundless sea of human beings!  And near the jail they
beheld the scaffold, and a sight which seemed to paralyze
the very life in their hearts.  For there, with the sheriff
and a group of her immediate friends, stood Sibyl
Campbell, whiter than the dead, robed for death, cold,
still, and rigid.
</p>

<p>
A deep, awe-struck silence had fallen over the vast
crowd&mdash;a silence more terrible than the wildest shouts
could have been.
</p>

<p>
Raising the white handkerchief, the boy waved it in
the air, shouting, wildly: "A reprieve&mdash;a reprieve!" and
drove furiously right through the startled throng,
heedless of those he trampled down in his way.
</p>

<p>
The multitude took up the cry, and "A reprieve! a
reprieve! a reprieve!" rang out, gathering force as it
went, until, from a low, hoarse shout, it rose to a wild,
triumphal song that rang to the very heavens.
</p>

<p>
And on, on, through the waving sea of human beings,
they drove, until they reached the scaffold; and then
rising to her feet, the thunder-struck spectators beheld
the pale, beautiful face of the long-lost Christie.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV.
<br><br>
MEETINGS AND PARTINGS.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "I am not mad; I would to heaven I were,<br>
  For then 'tis like I should forget myself.<br>
  Oh, if I could, what grief should I forget!"&mdash;SHAKESPEARE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For one moment, so great was the surprise, that
every shout was hushed, and the silence of death
reigned.  The next, a wild, fearful cry, that those
who heard would never forget, rang out, and a man, amid
the crowd, fell heavily to the ground.
</p>

<p>
There was a swaying to and fro, as the vast sea of
human beings made way for those who raised Edgar
Courtney, white and senseless, from the ground&mdash;a dark
stream of blood oozing from his lips&mdash;and a murmur ran
round: "He has burst a blood-vessel!"  But in another
moment he was forgotten, and every eye was riveted on
the scaffold; every ear was strained to hear what was
passing there.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl's mind, stunned by the many shocks it had lately
received had sunk into a sort of lethargy, from which
nothing could arouse her; and now she stared vaguely
at Christie, like one in a dream.
</p>

<p>
But, with a passionate exclamation, Mr. Brantwell
sprang forward and caught Christie's hand, exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
"Saved! saved!  Sibyl is saved!  Christie lives!"
</p>

<p>
And then the mob, catching up the words, sent forth
shout after shout, until the very air seemed to ring.
</p>

<p>
"Saved! saved!" repeated Christie, with wild exultation;
and then the unnatural strength that had hitherto
borne her up gave way, and she sank fainting in the arms
of Willard.
</p>

<p>
"Let us leave this horrible place," said Mr. Brantwell,
drawing Sibyl's arm within his own, and leading her
away.
</p>

<p>
"My carriage is near," said a gentleman who stood
beside them, "and I beg you to make use of it."
</p>

<p>
"I shall do so with pleasure.  Sir," to the sheriff, "I
presume Miss Campbell may now accompany me to the
hotel, since she is discovered to be innocent of the crime
with which she is charged?"
</p>

<p>
The sheriff bowed in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Drummond, you had better bring this young
girl also.  You perceive she has fainted," said
Mr. Brantwell.
</p>

<p>
The clergyman, with Sibyl, entered the carriage,
followed by Drummond bearing Christie, and then the
carriage drove rapidly away toward the hotel.
</p>

<p>
And the surprised and wondering crowd dispersed, to
spread the astonishing news far and wide.
</p>

<p>
Sibyl, like one in a dream, had allowed herself hitherto
to be led passively wherever they willed; but at the
entrance of Willard, she started, like one who receives a
galvanic shock; her face, a moment before like marble,
grew crimson; her wild, black eyes lit fiercely up; and
turning to Mr. Brantwell, she haughtily demanded:
</p>

<p>
"Why is he here?  How <i>dare</i> he ever enter my
presence again?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Sibyl, be reasonable," said the minister,
delighted that even anger should rouse her from her
apathy, "Mr. Drummond has saved your life."
</p>

<p>
"I would sooner die than owe my life to him!" she
said, passionately.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Sibyl," said the minister, soothingly, as he
cast a deprecating glance at Willard, "You mustn't talk
like this; it's very wrong, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Let her speak, Mr. Brantwell; I deserve it all," said
Willard, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
His words, the sound of his voice, wrought a revulsion
in her feelings, and she cried out, in a tone of
passionate reproach:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Willard, Willard! how could you deceive me
so?  I loved you so much, so much Willard, and yet you
deceived me!  Oh, it was cruel, it was base, it was
treacherous, it was unmanly to trifle with a poor young girl
thus!"
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, I am a wretch!  I dare not ask you to forgive
me!" he groaned, in bitterest remorse.
</p>

<p>
"And she&mdash;she is your wife, is she not?" she said,
fixing her flaming eyes, on the pale, wan face of Christie.
</p>

<p>
"She is; but she had no part in deceiving you, Sibyl;
all the blame must rest on me.  As I deceived you, so
did I deceive her, villain that I was," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Drummond, she is dead, I fear," said Mr. Brantwell,
looking in alarm at the white, rigid face of
Christie.
</p>

<p>
"No, she has only swooned; she breaths yet."
</p>

<p>
"Here we are, at the hotel, thank Heaven!" said the
minister, as the coach stopped.
</p>

<p>
A vast crowd had assembled here.  For a moment all
shrank from passing through it, but there was no help
for it.
</p>

<p>
"My brother is here?" said Sibyl, in a hurried whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Take me to his room then," she said, passing her arm
through that of the clergyman.
</p>

<p>
"You will take Mrs. Drummond to my apartment,"
said the minister, kindly; "the waiter will show you
where it is.  I will join you in a few moments."
</p>

<p>
Bearing the light form of his still senseless wife in his
arms, Willard entered the room and laid her on the bed.
</p>

<p>
The wife of the host entered with restoratives, but it
was long ere the heavy lids were raised from the sad blue
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My own Christie, you are better now?" said Willard,
bending over her.
</p>

<p>
She smiled faintly, and pressed her hand to her heart.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I will soon be better," she said, in a strange
tone.  "Willard, where is Sibyl?"
</p>

<p>
"With her brother, dearest."
</p>

<p>
"Have you told her all?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Christie, I have explained nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Send for her, then; for her brother, too, and
Mr. Brantwell.  I want to tell them all, and get Sibyl's
forgiveness before I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Before you&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, dearest Willard, Have you sent?"
</p>

<p>
A servant entered, and the message was delivered.
</p>

<p>
"But she has nothing to forgive you, Christie; you
never wronged her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I did.  I did, unintentionally, perhaps, but still
I wronged her.  Hark! they are coming, Willard."
</p>

<p>
There was a soft knock at the door.  Willard opened
it, and Mr. Brantwell, followed by Sibyl and Captain
Campbell, entered.  The young captain, pale, thin, and
haggard, cast a fierce, implacable glance at Willard; but
the sight of the frail, spiritual, attenuated form of
Christie checked the fierce, passionate words that were
already rising to his lips.
</p>

<p>
A great change was perceptible in Sibyl during these
few minutes.  The exhortations of the good clergyman
had evidently not been without effect; for her pale, worn
face had a calm, subdued look, as if she had at last
realized the great danger she had escaped.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Sibyl&mdash;dear Miss Sibyl, can you ever forgive
me?" said the sad, sweet voice of Christie, as she held out
her hand and looked wistfully, imploringly into Sibyl's
face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Christie, I have nothing to forgive you.  You
were not guilty," said Sibyl, sinking down by the bedside,
and hiding her face in Christie's little thin hand.
</p>

<p>
"Not willfully, but still I wronged you.  And there is
another&mdash;-will you not forgive him?"
</p>

<p>
"Never, so he'p me Heaven!" fiercely exclaimed
Sibyl, springing up and casting upon him a glance of
fire.
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, I am dying!  You will not refuse my last
request?  Oh, Sibyl, in a moment of thoughtless passion
he married me; but all the time he loved you best.  I
can see it all now.  He loved you then&mdash;he loves you
now, better than all the world."
</p>

<p>
"And you can forgive him for the irreparable wrong
he has done you&mdash;a deserted home, a blighted life, and an
early death?  Christie, you are an angel!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no; only a frail sinner, with so much to be forgiven
herself, that she can easily, joyfully forgive that.
Sibyl, my hours are numbered.  Will you render them
miserable by refusing my last request?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Christie, you know not what you ask!"
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, do you not love Willard still?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do&mdash;I do!  Heaven forgive me, I do!" she
said, passionately.
</p>

<p>
"And he loves you.  Willard, come here&mdash;take Sibyl's
hand.  Now, Sibyl, promise when I am gone to be his
wife."
</p>

<p>
There was a fierce struggle in the passionate heart of
Sibyl&mdash;a last struggle between love and pride, and her
burning sense of the great wrong he had done her.  With
her face bowed, her whole frame quivering, she did not
look up&mdash;would not speak, until the little hand of
Christie fell imploringly on her head.
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, I cannot go until you promise me this.  Oh,
Sibyl, I love you both so much that I would willingly die
to make you happy.  You love one another still; why
should this one fault, committed in a moment of
thoughtlessness make your whole future lives miserable?  Oh,
Sibyl, we have all so much to be forgiven, can you not
pardon this?"
</p>

<p>
Still no reply
</p>

<p>
"Sibyl, I am dying! if I can forgive the wrong done
me, why&mdash;oh, why cannot you?  Oh, Sibyl, cast out this
false pride that will make you wretched all your life, and
make my last moments happy by this promise.  Oh,
Sibyl, dearest Sibyl, consent!"
</p>

<p>
"Christie, you have conquered." said Sibyl, as she
kissed through her fast-falling tears, the pale brow of the
dying girl.  Then rising, she placed her hand in
Willard's, and said, with sad earnestness:
</p>

<p>
"Willard, we have both erred; let us forget the past.
I love you still, and forgive you all."
</p>

<p>
He did not reply&mdash;he could not speak; but he raised
the hand she extended to his lips, and turned toward the
window.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank Heaven&mdash;thank Heaven for this!" cried
Christie, exultingly.  "Now I can die in peace."
</p>

<p>
There was a low rap at the door.  Captain Campbell
opened it, and Laura Courtney, pale, wild and excited,
entered.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Courtney! <i>you</i> here?" exclaimed Mr. Brantwell,
in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Brantwell, Edgar is dying&mdash;the doctor says
so; and he is raving and saying the most frightful things.
He wants to see Captain Campbell and his sister
immediately."
</p>

<p>
"Me!" said Sibyl.  "What can he want with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do not know.  He is saying such dreadful
things!  Come with me," said Mrs. Courtney, catching
Sibyl's arm in a wild, terrified way and drawing her from
the room.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brantwell, Willard, and his dying girl-wife were
left alone.
</p>

<p>
"I want to see Aunt Tom and Carl," said Christie,
faintly.  "Do you know where they are to be found?"
</p>

<p>
"They are on the island," said Mr. Brantwell, "and
consequently have not heard of your arrival here.  I will
send a messenger over for them, if you wish."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes!" said Christie, eagerly; "send now&mdash;right
away."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brantwell left the room, and speedily returned to
say that a man had gone, and Mrs. Tom and her nephew
might be expected in a few hours.
</p>

<p>
And then the good clergyman came and sat down
beside the dying girl, and, taking her hand in his, began
talking in a low earnest tone, while Willard, with his
head bowed on his hand, sat by the window, absorbed by
many conflicting thoughts.
</p>

<p>
And thus an hour passed; and then Captain Campbell
and his sister returned, pale and excited, as if by some
strange tidings.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Courtney?" said the minister, inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Is dead!" answered Captain Campbell, with a slight
shudder.
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible?  How very sudden!" said Mr. Brantwell,
in surprise, "What was the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"He ruptured an artery this morning," replied the
young man, beginning to pace the room with rapid
strides: "and that, with the shock caused by the
unexpected appearance of Christie, caused his death."
</p>

<p>
"Christie's appearance!  How could that shock
him?" said the minister, still more surprised.
</p>

<p>
"He thought her dead&mdash;thought himself her murderer,
and fancied she had risen from the grave to accuse him,"
said Captain Campbell, excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"Thought himself her murderer!" said the minister,
still repeating the young man's words, like an echo.
"How was that?"
</p>

<p>
Both Christie and Willard fixed their eyes eagerly on
the excited face of the young captain.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it was he who stabbed her that night on the
beach.  He has confessed it all," said Captain Campbell.
</p>

<p>
"He stabbed her!" exclaimed Willard, springing to
his feet, while Christie uttered a faint cry; "and why, in
the name of Heaven, should he try to murder her?  What
had she ever done to him?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  He did not mean to injure Christie.  He
mistook her for his wife."
</p>

<p>
"Mistook me for his wife!" said Christie, like one in
a dream.  "And did he want to kill his wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; horrible as it seems, he wanted to kill her!"
said Captain Campbell.  "The way of it was this," he
said, stopping suddenly in his excited walk, "Courtney
was jealous of his wife; he fancied she had gone to keep
an appointment with some one on the island"&mdash;a slight
flush of crimson glowed for an instant on his dark cheek
as he spoke&mdash;"and he determined to follow her there.
He went.  In the storm and darkness he met Christie.
He thought her his wife, and stabbed her, and left her for
dead on the ground.  Some apparition that he met terrified
him, and he fled from the island&mdash;first returning to
the spot where he had left Christie; but finding the body
gone, swept away by the tide, as he imagined.  He
returned the next evening to the parsonage; there he
found his wife living, but hearing the rumor of Christie's
death, he knew he had stabbed her in his blind fury.  He
heard, also, that my sister had gone to the island that
night, and that a woman resembling her had been seen
flying through the storm about the time the deed was
committed, and the diabolical project entered his head of
having her accused of the murder, and thus freeing
himself forever from all possibility of blame.  How well he
succeeded, we all know; and Sibyl would have died an
ignominious death for his crime, had not a retributive
Providence sent Christie here at the eleventh hour to save
her, and bring his crime to light; but too late to save
her from the shame and humiliation of what has passed.
May the foul fiend catch his soul for it!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, brother! hush!" said Sibyl, laying her hand on
his arm.  "Remember you speak of the dead!"
</p>

<p>
"This is monstrous," said Mr. Brantwell, in a tone of
horror.  "I never dreamt that any man in his senses
could have committed such a crime."
</p>

<p>
"He was not in his senses," said Sibyl, "he was crazed
with jealousy."
</p>

<p>
"Was he not sane when he accused you&mdash;the double-dyed
perjurer?" exclaimed Captain Campbell, fiercely,
"Oh, why does God permit such frightful injustice to go
so long unpunished?  Where slept His thunderbolts that
this demon in human form was not stricken dead where
he stood?"
</p>

<p>
"Guy, my dear boy, be calm," interposed Mr. Brantwell.
"God is His own interpreter; and in His own
good time has seen fit to save your sister.  Let what is
past be forgotten&mdash;'let by-gones be by-gones.'"
</p>

<p>
"But Christie has not told us yet how she was saved."
said Sibyl; "all that is still involved in mystery."
</p>

<p>
Faintly, and in broken sentences, for her strength was
failing fast, Christie related all that the reader already
knows.  To explain the presence of Bertha on the island,
it was necessary, however painful it might be, to tell her
story; and Guy and Sibyl listened in sorrow and amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Then my father's wife lives yet," said Sibyl, slowly.
</p>

<p>
"And now I remember, though indistinctly, like a
dream, of catching a glimpse of a tall, dark, handsome
Woman in the upper rooms of the old lodge, when I was
a boy," said Guy, thoughtfully.  "It is strange I thought
so little of it at the time, for her presence there was
singular.  What terrible revelations time brings to light!
Who would ever suppose my father could have done such
a deed?"
</p>

<p>
"His child, too, may be living yet," said Mr. Brantwell.
"How unfortunate that there is no clew to tell
what may have been its fate."
</p>

<p>
Ere any one could reply, a bustle at the door arrested
their attention; and, the next moment, Mrs. Tom
entered, followed by Carl, and rushing to the bed,
clasped Christie in her arms, laughing and crying
hysterically.
</p>

<p>
"My own darling child! my own blessed baby! my
dear, darling little Christie!" were her exclamations,
between laughing, and crying, and hugging.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Aunt Tom! dear, good Aunt Tom!  Oh, I am
so glad, so glad to see you again!" said Christie, throwing
her arms round her neck, her wan face flushing with joy.
</p>

<p>
"And to think that you was married, and I never
knowed a word about it!  Lor' sakes! an' to be killed,
too, and come to life at the nick o' time!" said Mrs. Tom,
with another hug, and a laugh, and a fresh burst of tears.
"Carl, you great, lazy, idle vagabones, come over here
and see Christie, 'stead o' standing there, shiftin' from
one foot to another, like you had got into a nest o' young
wipers."
</p>

<p>
Thus adjured, in the sharp, peremptory tone that
reminded Christie of other days, Carl advanced and
pressed his lips to Christie's cheek as gingerly as though
he were afraid of burning himself.  Evidently relieved
when this was over, he edged off toward the door, and,
at the invitation of Sibyl, took a seat, and sat down on
the extreme edge of the chair.
</p>

<p>
And then, when Mrs. Tom had hugged and kissed
Christie to her heart's content, and laughed and cried
herself into something like composure, her first demand
was to Lear all that had happened "sence that there awful
night."
</p>

<p>
And Sibyl, fearing to further agitate Christie, who
had now fallen back, completely exhausted, on her pillow,
led the bustling little woman over to the window, and
seating herself near her, related all.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tom listened with many "lor' sakes'!" and
"gracious me's!" and "oh's!" and "ah, Lord's!" until
Sibyl began relating the maniac's story.  As she
proceeded, Mrs. Tom grew violently agitated; and before
she could reach the end, the old lady had jumped up, and,
pale and trembling, bent over Christie.
</p>

<p>
"Christie, look here," she said, excitedly, "that there
crazy woman had a little child, had she, the time she was
walled up in that room?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Christie, wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"That there little child was left in Campbell's Lodge,
with Mark Campbell, was it?" continued Mrs. Tom,
more and more agitated.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I believe so.  Why, Aunt Tom, what's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"And they never could find out what became of it
after, could they?" again asked Mrs. Tom, sinking into a
chair.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Why, what in the world does ail you, Aunt
Tom?" said Christie, in still increasing surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my Saviour!  Oh, my dear Lord!  Only to
think on it!  Christie, that there crazy woman is your
mother!  You are the little child that was left with Mark
Campbell!"
</p>

<p>
In a moment nearly all present were on their feet,
gazing in wonder and amaze on Mrs. Tom, and on each
other, as if asking what in the world they were destined
to hear next.
</p>

<p>
Christie, too weak now to betray any emotion, lay
still, with her wondering blue eyes fixed on the old
woman's face.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you needn't stare, all of you; it's jest so," said
Mrs. Tom, very much excited; "and the way of it was
this: One morning airly, jest as I riz, Mark Campbell
came into my cottage with something I took to be a
bundle, under his cloak.  He opened it, and you may
guess the astonishment I was in, when, instead o' a
bundle, he laid the sweetest, dearest, puttiest little baby on
the table ever I seed.  Lor' sakes!  I was so completely
consternified I hadn't a word to say, but jest stood starin'
with my mouth wide open, fust at him and then at the
baby that was sleepin' like a sweet little angel.  Before I
could ask him a single blessed question 'bout it, he sez
to me:
</p>

<p>
"'Mrs. Tom, there's a child I want tooken care of.
Ef you'll do it, I'll pay you; if you won't&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what he was going to say, for I broke
out with the greatest string o' questions just then that
ever was, asking him all about the baby; but he only
looked fierce, and wouldn't tell me a word.
</p>

<p>
"'If you will take it, Mrs. Tom,' sez he, 'you shall be
well rewarded for taking care of it; but you must
never, while I live, breathe to a living soul that I left it
with you.  If you do,' sez he, 'it will be all the worse
for you.'
</p>

<p>
"'And its mother,' sez I; 'Where's she?'
</p>

<p>
"My conscience! if you had seen him then!  His face
got like a thunder-cloud, and he said, in a voice that
made me tremble&mdash;yes, even me, and there ain't many
I'd tremble before, thank the Lord:
</p>

<p>
"'Never mention that word again, or I swear I'll
blow your brains out as I would a rabbit's!'
</p>

<p>
"And then he rushed from the house, leaving me
more astonished and frightened than ever I had been
before in all my born days.
</p>

<p>
"But I kept the baby, and called it 'Christina,' after
a sister I had once (Carl Henley's mother, poor thing! that
went and heaved herself away on a vagabones of a
fellow), and kept it till it grew up.  Mark Campbell died
a little while after, but we never spoke another word
about the child; but now I know, arter hearing about the
crazy woman, she was its mother."
</p>

<p>
Aunt Tom paused for breath, and Sibyl, with a great
cry, sprang forward and clasped Christie in her arms.
</p>

<p>
"My sister! my sister! my dear little sister!" she
exclaimed, through her fast falling tears.  "Oh, Christie! oh,
Christie! to discover you are my sister when it is too
late!"
</p>

<p>
With her arms round Sibyl's neck, her golden head
lying on her shoulder, Christie said, in a voice, so faint
that Sibyl had to stoop down very low to hear her:
</p>

<p>
"I am going, Sibyl, dear sister Sibyl!  Tell Guy, my
brother, and Aunt Tom, to come and bid me good-by."
</p>

<p>
In a voice choked with sobs, Sibyl called them to the
bedside, to receive that parting embrace.  Guy's eyes
were full of tears, and Mrs. Tom's sobs resounded audibly
through the room.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Sibyl, my own, my darling sister, good-by,
and Heaven bless you.  Hush! do not weep so;" and the
little wan arms clasped Sibyl's neck in a last embrace.
"Dearest Sibyl, go now and send Willard to me."
</p>

<p>
Pressing a last kiss on the transparent brow, Sibyl
arose, and beckoned Willard to approach.
</p>

<p>
Calm and tearless, but pale with a grief too intense
for tears, he came over.  A flush of love and joy lit up
the wan face at his approach, her arms&mdash;with a last
effort&mdash;encircled his neck; the golden head dropped on his
breast, while the sweet beautiful lips murmured:
</p>

<p>
"Dear Willard! dearest Willard! good-by!  I am
going; going to heaven to pray for you and Sibyl.  You
will try to be very happy, and make her very happy,
when I am gone&mdash;will you not?  Lift me up, Willard,
and carry me to the window, I want to see the beautiful
sunlight once more."
</p>

<p>
He lifted the slight little form, and sat down, with her
in his arms, beside the window.  A bright ray of sunshine
flashed in, and lit up with a sort of glory the
angel-brow, the golden hair, and the sweet, pale face.
</p>

<p>
Colder and colder grew the hand in his; lower sank
the head on his bosom; fainter and fainter beat the
gentle, loving heart.  No sound, save the suppressed sobs of
Mrs. Tom, broke the stillness of the room.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the closed eyes flew open, with a vivid,
radiant light; the sweet lips Darted in a smile of ineffable
joy; and she half rose from her recumbent posture.  The
next, she fell back; the blue eyes closed; a slight shiver
passed through her frame; and the streaming sunshine
fell on the face of the dead.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
One year after, there was a wedding&mdash;a very quiet,
private one&mdash;at the little church of N&mdash;&mdash;.  And when it
was over, Sibyl and Willard entered their plain, dark
traveling carriage, and bidding good-by to their friends
assembled in the parsonage, set out for Willard's
Virginia home&mdash;where, in the unclouded sunshine of the
future, they soon forgot, or learned to only look back
with tender regret, to the sufferings and sorrows of the
past.
</p>

<p>
Christie was not forgotten.  The oldest daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Drummond, a gentle, dark-eyed girl, bears
her name.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Three months after the marriage of Sibyl, her brother
led to the altar Laura Courtney, whose natural vivacity
soon overcame the shock she had received by the sudden
death of Edgar Courtney, her unloved husband; and
three days later, in the good bark "Evening Star," she
was dancing over the bright waves of the Atlantic, on her
way to Europe with Captain Campbell.
</p>

<p>
Willard Drummond sent for Uncle Reuben and Bertha,
and for several years they resided with him.  But
when at last the gentle maniac passed in peace away, her
faithful cousin bade them farewell, and set out for his
boyhood home, to pass his last days under the old roof-tree.
</p>

<p>
And Aunt Tom, good old Aunt Tom, staid still on the
island, which no persuasions could ever induce her to
leave, and there brought up Mr. Carl Henley in the way
he should go; and employed her whole heart and soul in
the, alas! vain labor of curing him of the sin of laziness.
If any reader is concerned in knowing the future fate of
that interesting young gentleman, I am happy to say,
when he arrived at the years of discretion, he made the
acquaintance of a strapping, strong-armed, red-cheeked
German girl, who fell violently in love with the
tallow-candle complexion and tow locks of the fascinating
youth.  Mr. Henley, after revolving the matter over
profoundly in all its bearings, came to the conclusion that
he might as well marry her as not, which he accordingly
did, in the "fullness of time"&mdash;having previously
extorted a promise from her to do all the work.
Mrs. Tom, who had an invincible antipathy to "furriners,"
looked with dislike at first on her niece-in-law; but the
unvarying good humor of Mrs. Henley, and her willingness
to work, soon completely gained the good old lady's
affections, and mastered her prejudices.

THE END.
